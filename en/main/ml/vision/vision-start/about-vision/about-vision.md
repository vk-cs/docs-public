Vision is a technology for recognizing faces, objects, processes based on machine learning and artificial neural networks. Vision will automate and improve the accuracy of complex visual inspection of varying complexity.

*   98% accuracy of face detection among a million
*   TensorRT on inference, <10ms on photo on GPU
*   314 scene recognition classes, 25,000 object classes

Vision technologies are available through APIs that are constantly evolving. A list of them is available in this help center. Using the API, you can solve such cases as:

*   Definition of scenes and objects
*   Tracking people
*   Celebrity recognition
*   Recognizing text in images
*   Vehicle detection
*   Increase resolution
*   Search for attractions
*   Identification of a manufacturing defect
*   Determination of car numbers
*   Image moderation
