Alerting is a metric change notification service that collects cloud resources.

You can independently configure and receive notifications about the status of cloud resources. For example, about changing the state of your virtual machine or database and responding to the problem. This way, you can prevent potential crashes in your applications rather than learning about them after the fact.

Alerting monitors changes in certain metrics using trigger rules and sends notifications through notification channels.

To start working with the service, you should register on the VK CS platform, go to your personal account and make sure that the monitoring service is active and the account balance is positive. It also requires that a virtual machine or database instance has been created. Then go to the "Monitoring" â†’ "Alerting" section.
