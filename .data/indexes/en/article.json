For its operation, the virtual machine uses the resources of a physical server (host). Multiple VMs can be hosted on the same host.\n\nFlavors\n\nOn the VK Cloud platform, the number of processors and the amount of RAM of the VM are set using flavors. Readymade flavors are available to users, as well as individual (on request).\n\nVolumes\n\nA disk on the VK Cloud platform is a network block storage device that connects to a VM. The amount of stored data and the speed of access to it depends on the size and type of disk.\n\nThe VK Cloud disk subsystem uses network drives. Disk fault tolerance, continuous access to data and their safety are ensured by replication.\n\nNetwork drives can be partitioned and formatted in the same way as regular locally connected drives. The advantage of network drives: they can be “moved” between VMs located in the same data center.\n\nMultiple disks can be attached to a VM, but at least one of them must be bootable and contain the installed operating system.\n\nAvailability zone\n\nAn availability zone is one or more data centers in which components of the cloud infrastructure can be placed. In VK Cloud, the availability zone corresponds to a separate Tier III data center.\n\nEach zone is isolated from failures in other availability zones. Placing virtual resources in multiple zones provides fault tolerance and reduces the likelihood of data loss.\n\nAll availability zones in the Moscow region are connected into a fully redundant fiberoptic network, which provides high speed and low latency when transferring data between availability zones.\n\nImage\n\nThe configuration and data of the virtual machine are stored as one or more files. These files can be used as an image to run a VM in a local environment or to create a new VM.\n\nOn the VK Cloud platform, you can create an image based on a VM disk or upload an image file. The resulting image can be used to create a new virtual machine.\n\nLoad balancer\n\nThe load balancer allows you to distribute incoming traffic between multiple virtual backend servers and thereby ensure high availability for the services provided by those servers. If one or more servers fail, traffic will be redirected to the remaining servers. Also the separate type of load balancer is used to power other VK Cloud platform services.\n\nThe VK Cloud platform load balancer is based on OpenStack Octavia, which has HAProxy at its core.\n\nSecurity group\n\nSecurity group is a sets of configurable permissive rules that regulate network access rights (sign in via a specific protocol, through a specific port) for certain IP addresses or other security groups.\n","url":"/en/intro/start/concepts/help-glossary","categoryPartialPath":"/en/intro","description":"Terms specific to cloud infrastructure.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"How to start","link":"/en/intro","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Getting started","link":"/en/intro/start","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"159ca4db-a57f-4f84-ad84-f96f4504388e","title":"Platform architecture","data":"Virtualization, monitoring, container, and data storage services can be deployed in VK Cloud. The architecture is based on four groups of services:\n\nIaaS services are built on the basis of OpenStack and components of its own design. Manage dynamic resource allocation, scaling, and fault tolerance. Hosted in the same cloud data center with PaaS services.\n\n    List of IaaS services\n\n  Cloud Servers (IaaS Compute) — provides virtual machines with the ability to allocate public IP and unlimited traffic of 1 GBit/s (also available virtual machines with NVIDIA GPU). Responsible for virtualization and resource integration, uses the KVM hypervisor.\n  Cloud Storage (IaaS Storage) — provides S3compatible object storage. The workload on the storage is distributed among all storage nodes. You can deploy a storage with a custom architecture.\n  Cloud Networks (IaaS Network) — provides network interaction within the selected project using SDN (Software Defined Network) technology. It operates on the basis of OpenStack Neutron and on the basis of proprietary software — Sprut. Includes components:\n\n    DNS — supports public and private DNS, which provides name resolution for VK Cloud platform services.\n    CDN — organizes the transfer of content from your servers to users with minimal delay.\n    Load Balancer — distributes the load on the infrastructure, providing fault tolerance and flexible scaling of applications.\n    AntiDDoS — filters traffic coming to VK Cloud resources deployed in the project to block DDoS attacks.\n    WAF (Web Application Firewall) — configures incoming and outgoing traffic filtering rules to detect and block network attacks.\n\n\nPaaS services include open source solutions (Kubernetes) and solutions from technology partners. Builtin monitoring of VK Cloud services and individual entities is supported.\n\n    List of PaaS services\n\n  Cloud Containers — allows you to create and manage Kubernetes clusters in which you can run services and applications.\n  Cloud Databases — provides scalable DBMS: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Postgres Pro, ClickHouse, MongoDB, Redis, Tarantool, OpenSearch, Arenadata DB based on Greenplum.\n  Cloud Big Data — used for big data analysis based on Arenadata Hadoop, supports scaling.\n  Cloud Streams — provides Arenadata Streamingbased clusters for processing streaming data.\n  Cloud ML Platform — supports services for a full ML development cycle.\n  Cloud Voice — provides a REST API for speech recognition and synthesis based on machine learning.\n  Vision — provides a REST API for face and object recognition based on machine learning.\n  Cloud Alerting —  configures notifications about changes in key metrics of VK Cloud services.\n  Cloud Logging — aggregates and analyzes service logs in VK Cloud.\n  Monitoring — provides monitoring of metrics specific to PaaS services, for example, analytics on K8s container feeds, PostgreSQL DBMS transaction statistics.\n  Additional services:\n\n    1C:Ready workplace — provides resources and software for the deployment of 1C services: Accounting, Salary and Personnel Management, Management of our company.\n    Marketplace — allows you to quickly deploy web development and administration environments based on virtual machines.\n\n\nCommon&Securityservices ensure the safe operation of users and support a role model when using VK Cloud resources.\n\n    List of Common&Security Services\n\n  Billing — keeps records of resource usage and expense control, generates financial reports, provides interaction with payment systems when paying for services.\n  Audit — generates an audit log of user actions in VK Cloud.\n  IAM — manages authentication and authorization of users and services in conjunction with Keystone.\n  Cloud Monitoring — provides monitoring of cloud services and user applications.\n  Keystone — provides API client authentication, service discovery, and distributed multitenant authorization.\n\n\nVK Cloud provides technical support for its services. Partner solutions (for example, AntiDDoS, WAF) are supported jointly with a partner.\n\nThe general scheme of VK Cloud components and services is shown below.\n\nVK Cloud architectureparamsnoBordertrue\n\nCloud services are managed using the API. Users interact with the API through one or more tools:\n\nVK Cloud management console;\nOpenStack CLI;\nTerraform with a separate provider.\n\nFault tolerance\n\nPhysical fault tolerance is implemented by placing VK Cloud in three Tier III reliability level data centers in the Russian Federation. With this placement, it is guaranteed to maintain the SLA of data centers of more than 98% with a total SLA of 99.95%.\n\nNetwork fault tolerance is provided by communication of data centers with routes with a bandwidth of 200 GB/sec. Communication of each server with backbone providers goes through two independent channels, through two routers.\n\nLogical fault tolerance is implemented using availability zones, which are combined into regions.\n\n\n\nThe status of the availability zones, services and infrastructure of VK Cloud can be checked on the services page status page.\n\nheading(Availability zones)idaz\n\nEach availability zone has one or more data processing centers (data centers) where cloud infrastructure objects are physically located. In VK Cloud, the availability zone corresponds to a separate Tier III data center. VK Cloud provides availability zones:\n\nGZ1: includes a data center Goznak;\n\n  The address of the data center: Moscow, Mira avenue, 105, building 6.\n\nMS1: includes a data center DataLine NORD4;\n\n  The address of the data center: Moscow, Korovinskoe highway, 41.\n\nME1: includes a data center «Medvedkovo» RostelecomDPC;\n\n  The address of the data center: Moscow, Chermyanskaya st., 4.\n\nQAZ: includes a data center QazCloud.\n\n  The address of the data center: Republic of Kazakhstan, Akmola region, Kosshy, Republic str. 1.\n\nEach data center is equipped with independent power supply and cooling systems.\n\nAvailability zones within a region are connected using a redundant dedicated highbandwidth and lowlatency fiber network for high data transfer rates between zones.\n\nThe infrastructure of availability zones MS1 and GZ1 of the Moscow VK Cloud region is protected in accordance with the Federal Law of the Russian Federation “On Personal Data” No. 152FZ.\n\nSecurity\n\nVK Cloud security is ensured by constant monitoring of VK Cloud services, conducting external audits. VK Cloud participates in the security audit program HackerOne. Infrastructure certified FSTEC of Russia for working with personal data.\n\nFor more information, see the section Platform security.\n\nMigration to VK Cloud\n\nVK Cloud supports migration using thirdparty software or platform tools. The transfer of virtual resources is cheaper due to the implementation of services based on OSS (Open Source Solutions).\n","url":"/en/intro/start/concepts/architecture","categoryPartialPath":"/en/intro","description":"Description of VK Cloud architecture, security and fault tolerance of the platform, migration to VK Cloud.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"How to start","link":"/en/intro","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Getting started","link":"/en/intro/start","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"06da76c0-a256-4e4d-a3a3-ef75a2b20dac","title":"Registration in VK Cloud","data":"These instructions will help you to register in VK Cloud.

Ответственность Сторон\n\n5.1. Размер ответственности Компании ограничен исключительно соответствующими Применимыми правилами, размещенным на Сайте в разделе https://help.mail.ru/mcs/legal/.\n\n5.2. Упущенная выгода Заказчика возмещению Компанией не подлежит.\n\n5.3. Компания не несёт ответственности перед Заказчиком за блокировку доступа к Контенту Заказчика, или уничтожение Контента в случае, если Компанией были получены соответствующие претензии третьих лиц, либо предупреждения, предписания или иные акты органов государственной власти в отношении действий Заказчика с использованием Сервиса.\n\n5.4. Компания не несет ответственности за любые нарушения действующего законодательства, которые имеют или могут иметь место на проектах, реализуемых Заказчиком. В случае предъявления к Компании претензий от третьих лиц в связи с такими имевшими место нарушениями Заказчик обязан освободить Компании от ответственности и урегулировать такие претензии самостоятельно, а также возместить все убытки, понесённые Компанией по вине Заказчика, в полном объеме, в том числе, но не ограничиваясь: по урегулированию претензий, споров, исполнению санкций органов государственной власти, должны быть возмещены Компании в случае наличия таковых.\n\n6\\. Прочие условия\n\n6.1. Заказчик гарантирует, что его Контент, размещаемый с использованием Сервиса Компании, не содержит информацию и изображения порнографического характера, не пропагандирует насилие, расовое, половое, религиозное или другие формы неравенства, либо иную деятельность, прямо запрещенную законодательством Российской Федерации, не нарушает законодательство об авторском праве и иное действующее законодательство, поскольку это может повлиять на репутацию Компании.\n\n6.2.

Время недоступности Сервиса, связанное с проведением профилактических работ, не подлежит компенсации по правилам п. 6.6. Соглашения.\n\n6.6.

Если Компания располагает собственными данными о начале Даунтайма, указывающими на более раннее время начала недоступности Сервиса, чем время отправки сообщения по электронной почте на адрес support@mcs.mail.ru или форму обратной связи в Личном кабинете, Компания может использовать такие данные. Разногласия о времени начала и окончания Даунтайма решаются путём переговоров Сторон. Если Даунтайм начался в одном Отчетном периоде, а окончился в следующем Отчетном периоде, то недоступность Сервиса полностью относится к тому Отчетному периоду, в котором имела место большая часть Даунтайма.\n\n6.7.

В любых случаях нарушения гарантий уровня Сервиса Заказчик обязуется сотрудничать с Компанией для определения источника проблем, его устранения и восстановления работоспособности Сервиса или удаленного/поврежденного Контента.\n\n6.9. Расчет Компенсации осуществляется автоматически на основании данных статистики Компании. Сумма Компенсации перечисляется на счет Заказчика в размере, определяемом на основании правил п. 6.7. настоящего Соглашения в течение 7 (семи) рабочих дней с момента начала Отчетного периода, следующего за тем, в котором имели место события, послужившие основанием для Компенсации.\n\n6.10. Размер Компенсации в течение Отчетного периода по обоим основаниям, указанным в п.п. 6.6. и 6.7. Соглашения, не может превышать размер средств, оплаченных Заказчиком за Отчетный период, в котором имели место события, послужившие основанием для Компенсации.\n\n6.11. Не подлежит Компенсации недоступность Сервиса, вызванная действиями Заказчика или третьих лиц, либо обстоятельствами непреодолимой силы, которые повлекли за собой недоступность услуг; приостановка оказания услуг, связанная с проведением запланированных профилактических работ, как определено в п. 6.5. настоящего Соглашения; приостановка оказания услуг по требованию государственных или муниципальных органов в случаях и порядке, определенным применимым законодательством. Компания ни при каких обстоятельствах не возмещает Заказчику Сервиса косвенные убытки, в том числе упущенную выгоду и причиненный вред деловой репутации.\n\nРедакция: от 18.10.2022 г.\n","url":"/en/intro/start/legal/policy-cdn","categoryPartialPath":"/en/intro","description":"","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"How to start","link":"/en/intro","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Getting started","link":"/en/intro/start","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"75ccf8ec-01b5-4a05-ad33-35d97241d2e2","title":"User agreement for the service “Cloud for hot data” (Hotbox)","data":"This document is an official offer of Mail.ru LLC (hereinafter — the \"Company\") to conclude a user agreement (hereinafter — the \"Agreement\") with you (hereinafter — the \"Customer\") on the provision of services for providing access to the Service \"Cloud for Hot Data\" as part of the VK Cloud Platform (hereinafter referred to as the Platform), on the terms set forth in this Agreement, which is available on the Internet at: https://mcs.mail.ru/docs//en/intro/start/legal/policyhotbox.\n\n1\\.

For its operation, the virtual machine uses the resources of a physical server (host). Multiple VMs can be hosted on the same host.\n\nWhen creating a virtual machine, its configuration is set:\n\nnumber of processors (CPU);\nthe amount of RAM;\ndisk type and size;\navailability zone;\noperating system.\n\n\n\nVirtual machines created on the VK Cloud platform use BIOS emulation. UEFI emulation is not supported.\n\nServer Group\n\nA server group is a collection of servers within a cluster that are combined in accordance with a specific policy. The server refers to resources:\n\nvirtual machines;\nDB instances;\nK8s clusters;\napplication instances from the App Store.\n\nThe policy determines the allocation of resources on the platform compute nodes. Supported policies:\n\naffinity — place a VM on a single compute node;\nantiaffinity — place VMs on different compute nodes;\nsoftaffinity — if possible, place the VM on one compute node (if there is not enough space on one node, instead of a creation error, as in the case of affinity, a server will be created on another compute node);\nsoftantiaffinity — place the VM on different compute node, if possible.\n\nExample of using a server group: deploy multiple application VMs on only one node to speed up communication between these VMs.\n\nFlavors\n\nOn the VK Cloud platform, the number of processors and the amount of RAM of the VM are set using flavors.\n\nVirtual machine categories\n\nVMs are grouped into categories in a management console:\n\ncols\"1,2,2\", options\"header\"\n\n Category\n Description\n Display condition\n\n Intel Cascade Lake (Intel Xeon Gen 2)\n VMs located on servers with Intel Cascade Lake CPU\n Available by default\n\n Intel Ice Lake (Intel Xeon Gen 3)\n VMs located on servers with Intel Ice Lake CPU\n Available by default\n\n Archived VM types (legacy)\n Old VM configuration templates\n Not displayed by default filtration\n\n Highperformance CPU\n VMs located on servers with increased CPU clock speed\n Displayed when ordering the types of VM through technical support\n\n Virtual machines with GPU\n VMs with connected graphics card\n Displayed when ordering the types of VM through cloud.vk.com\n\n VMs with local disks\n VMs with the ability to use local hypervisor disks\n Displayed when ordering the types of VM through technical support\n\n VMs located on dedicated servers\n VMs located on hypervisors dedicated to the needs of one client\n Displayed when ordering the types of VM through your manager\n\n\nBy default, only actual configuration templates are displayed: on servers with Intel Cascade Lake and Intel Ice Lake CPUs, as well as VMs with a connected graphics card, on highperformance or dedicated servers, if they were added to the project.\n\nTo add custom VM configurations to the list, including VMs with more than 16 vCPU and 64 GB of RAM, contact technical support.\n\nSelect the Archive VM types category to find the old VM configuration templates. The server for VMs of the old configuration is selected randomly: Intel Cascade Lake or Intel Ice Lake, but charged at the price of Intel Ice Lake. If the server is unavailable (for example, during maintenance work), these VMs can move to a server of a different generation.\n\n\n    Archived VM types\n\n Flavor's name  Configuration Parameters  Description \n      \n Basic  Up to 2 vCPU  Up to 4 Gb RAM  Basic flavors for creating a VM with low performance \n Standard  From 2 to 4 vCPUs  From 4 Gb to 16 Gb RAM  Configurations with increased CPU and RAM capacity \n Advanced  From 8 to 16 vCPU  From 16 Gb to 64 Gb RAM  Configurations for creating highperformance VMs \n Heavy  Up to 16 vCPU  Up to 64 Gb RAM  Customized configurations for creating highperformance VMs \n Custom  Unlimited  Individual configurations \n\n\n\nTo create additional VM templates (for example, with a large amount of resources) contact technical support. The cost of a VM in this case is calculated individually for each request.\n\n\n\nThe number and type of CPU, as well as the amount of RAM of an already created virtual machine, can be changed by changing the VM template. This process will require a VM reboot.\n\nName of VM configuration templates\n\nThe name of the VM template on servers with Intel Cascade Lake, Intel Ice Lake CPUs and a VM with a connected graphics card is formed as follows:\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\nVM template name  Description \n    \n STD224  VM with Intel Cascade Lake processor, 2 vCPUs and 4 GB of RAM \n STD348  VM with Intel Ice Lake processor, 4 vCPU and 8 GB RAM \n GPU1A3296A1001  VM with AMD EPYC 7662 processor and one connected Nvidia Tesla A10040GB graphics card \n\nheading(CPU generations)idcpu_generations\n\nThe performance of a VM depends on the resources of the host on which it is hosted. The VK Cloud platform provides server hardware that allows you to configure VMs of different performance levels.\n\nVK Cloud platform has different CPU for VM hosting:\n\n CPU  Type and generation of CPU  Availability \n      \n Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6230 CPU @ 2.10GHz  Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6238R CPU @ 2.20GHz  Intel Cascade Lake (Intel Xeon Gen 2)  Available by default \n Intel Xeon Gold 6338 @ 2.0GHz  Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 CPU @ 2.3GHz  Intel Ice Lake (Intel Xeon Gen 3)  Available by default \n Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6230 CPU @ 3.40GHz  Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6238R CPU @ 3.70GHz  Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8380 CPU @ 3.4GHz  Highperformance processors  Available on request \n AMD EPYC 7662  Select GPU VMs only  Available on request \n\nThe configurations available by default allow you to create VMs on servers with standard CPU.\n\nDisks\n\nA disk on the VK Cloud platform is a network block storage device that connects to a VM. The amount of stored data and the speed of access to it depends on the size and type of disk.\n\nThe VK Cloud disk subsystem uses network drives. Disk fault tolerance, continuous access to data and their safety are ensured by replication.\n\nNetwork drives can be partitioned and formatted in the same way as regular locally connected drives. The advantage of network drives: they can be “moved” between VMs located in the same data center.\n\nLow Latency NVME local disks are available in highperformance configurations. To create such a configuration contact technical support.\n\nAfter creating a disk, you can change its size, type, and availability zone. The disk can be renamed, connected or disconnected from the VM, cloned or deleted. The boot disk can be made nonbootable and vice versa.\n\nMultiple disks can be attached to a VM, but at least one of them must be bootable and contain the installed operating system.\n\n\n\nIf the VM and disk are located in different availability zones, the disk access speed may be reduced.\n\nDisks types\n\nThe VK Cloud platform supports various types of disks:\n\ncols\"1,1,1,3\", options\"header\"\n\n Disk Type\n Name in the API\n Availability zones\n Description\n\n Network HDD\n cephhdd\n MS1, GZ1, ME1\n An ordinary magnetic hard drive.

Switchover time in case of storage server failure is from 30 sec to 5 min.\n\nAccording to the ISCSI protocol, the disk wait time in case of loss of availability is 300 sec. During this time, the VM operating system will switch to the backup storage server. However, conduct additional testing with disk failure emulation if you will use the disk to host highly loaded DBMS\n\n\n\n   Information about outdated resource names\n\nSome names of disk types and availability zones are outdated, but are displayed in the output of commands.\n\nCompliance of outdated and current names:\n\n Disk Type  Outdatedname in the API  Availabilityzone  Actualname in the API  Actualavailability zone \n\n Network HDD  dp1                      DP1               cephhdd                   GZ1                         \n              ms1                      MS1               cephhdd                   MS1                         \n Network SSD  dp1ssd                  DP1               cephssd                   GZ1                         \n              ko1ssd                  MS1               cephssd                   MS1                         \n Network HighIOPS SSD  dp1highiops  DP1               highiops                  GZ1                         \n                        ko1highiops  MS1               highiops                  MS1                         \n\nUnavailable disk types:\n\n Disk Type  Name in the API  Availability zone \n\n Network HDD with georeplication  ceph    nova    \n Network SSD with georeplication  ssd     nova    \n\nAvailability zone\n\nAn availability zone is one or more data centers in which components of the cloud infrastructure can be placed. In VK Cloud, the availability zone corresponds to a separate Tier III data center.\n\nEach zone is isolated from failures in other availability zones. Placing virtual resources in multiple zones provides fault tolerance and reduces the likelihood of data loss.\n\nVK Cloud platform resources are hosted in data centers:\n\nGZ1 – Goznak data center. Address: Moscow, Prospekt Mira, 105, building 6.\nMS1 (ko1) – DataLine NORD4 data center. Address: Moscow, Korovinskoe highway, 41.\nQAZ — QazCloud data center. Address: Republic of Kazakhstan, Akmola region, Kosshy, Republic str. 1.\n\nIn the MS1 availability zone, the VK Cloud infrastructure is protected in accordance with the Federal Law of the Russian Federation “On Personal Data” No. 152FL.\n\nVK Cloud distributes the following virtual resources across availability zones:\n\nvirtual machines;\ndisks: are placed in network block storage and are automatically replicated within their availability zone;\nload balancers.\n\nNetworks and routers are not tied to availability zones.\n\n\n\nA network created in the QAZ availability zone cannot be united with networks in other availability zones, since QAZ zone is located in the Kazakhstan region. In this case, networks can be connected over VPN.\n\nOperating system\n\nOn the VK Cloud platform, when creating a virtual machine, you can choose an operating system of the Microsoft Windows or Linux family. To create a VM with an operating system that is not in the platform list, use the VM image file with the required OS.\n\nVK Cloud supports migration of Windows server versions:\n\nWindows Server 2008 / 2008 R2;\nWindows Server 2012 / 2012 R2;\nWindows Server 2016;\nWindows Server 2019;\nWindows Server 2022.\n\n\n\nIt is not possible to use Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 / 10 / 11 operating systems in VK Cloud. This restriction is set for all projects and cannot be lifted.\n\nImage\n\nThe configuration and data of the virtual machine are stored as one or more files. These files can be used as an image to run a VM in a local environment or to create a new VM.\n\nOn the VK Cloud platform, you can create an image based on a VM disk or upload an image file. The resulting image can be used to create a new virtual machine.\n\nAn image, the source of which is a disk, allows you to create a copy of a virtual machine with an installed and configured operating system and applications.\n\nThe image downloaded from the file can be used for VM migration or to create a virtual machine with your operating system.\n\n\n\nCloud Servers supports images in the raw format.\n\nFile storage\n\nFile storage is a virtual file system that can be connected to multiple virtual machines and used to share data. When creating a file storage, the network access protocol to it (NFS or CIFS) is specified.\n\n\n\nFile storage is accessed only from virtual machines inside the VK Cloud project.\n\n\n\nThe size of the file storage is set at the creation stage. If necessary, the size of the file storage can be increased, but the file storage cannot be reduced.\n\nSnapshot creation and snapshot recovery operations are available for file repositories.\n\nBackup\n\nA VM backup is needed to restore the state of the VM saved at a certain point in time. The VK Cloud platform provides a service for creating VM backups in manual or automatic mode.\n\nIn manual mode, the creation of backups is started by the user. At the same time, full VM backups are created.\n\nAutomatic mode supports GFS strategy and allows you to configure a backup schedule to create full and incremental backups.\n\nLicenses\n\nVK Cloud has the right to license software based on agreements with companies:\n\nMicrosoft (Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement — SPLA);\nRED SOFT;\nBaseALT;\nAstra Linux.\n\nFor more information, see the VM Licenses section.\n","url":"/en/computing/iaas/concepts/about","categoryPartialPath":"/en/computing","description":"Cloud Servers Concept — basic concepts related to virtual machines.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Computing","link":"/en/computing","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Servers","link":"/en/computing/iaas","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"857af423-bdae-4a4b-a6ab-6228144ba462","title":"VK Cloud Disk Performance","data":"Various types of disks are used in the data storage system on the VK Cloud platform:\n\nHDD\nSSD\nHighIOPS SSD\nHighIOPS HA SSD\nLow Latency NVME\n\nRead more in the article Cloud Servers overview.\n\nCertain performance characteristics are guaranteed for each type of disk.

Each NIC queue requires a MSI vector, as well as any virtio device or assigned PCI device. Defining an instance with multiple virtio NICs and vCPUs might lead to a possibility of hitting the guest MSI limit.\nVirtionet multiqueue works well for incoming traffic, but can occasionally cause a performance degradation, for outgoing traffic.\nEnabling virtionet multiqueue increases the total network throughput, but in parallel it also increases the CPU consumption.\nEnabling virtionet multiqueue in the host QEMU config, does not enable the functionality in the guest OS. The guest OS administrator needs to manually turn it on for each guest NIC that requires this feature, using ethtool.\nMSI vectors would still be consumed (wasted), if multiqueue was enabled in the host, but has not been enabled in the guest OS by the administrator.\nIn case the number of vNICs in a guest instance is proportional to the number of vCPUs, enabling the multiqueue feature is less important.\n\n\n\nOn the VK Cloud platform, it is not enough to enable multiqueue only at the image level (in the QEMU configuration). The OS administrator needs to manually enable the functionality using ethtool for VMs that were created before enabling multiqueue.\n\n1.

If the VM is stopped, the funds are debited only for the use of licenses and disk space.\n\nCharged:\n\nCPU (vCPU) — for each core. 1 vCPU corresponds to 1 physical core of the virtualization server.\nRandom access memory (RAM) — for each 1 GB of RAM.\nLicenses (for example, on Windows OS) — for each of license, regardless of whether the license is activated or not.\nDisks — for each 1 GB of disk space, the price depends on the type of disk (SSD, HDD, HighIOPS, Low Latency NVME).\nFile storage (NFS/CIFS) — for every 1 GB of disk space.\nDisk snapshot (backup) — for every 1 GB of snapshot size.\nDisk images — for each 1 GB of image size (for the price of an HDD).\nIP addresses — for more information, see Virtual networks.\n\nWhat is not charged\n\nIncoming and outgoing traffic.\nMonitoring.\n\nExample of price calculation\n\nFor example, the price of a virtual machine with Ubuntu Linux OS, 4 CPU, 16 GB RAM, 100 GB SSD disk and public IP will be calculated as follows:\n\n(4 x cost for 1 vCPU) + (16 x cost for 1 GB RAM) + (100 x cost for 1 GB for SSD) + (1 x cost for public IP)\n","url":"/en/computing/iaas/tariffication","categoryPartialPath":"/en/computing","description":"How the Cloud Servers is charged, cost calculation.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Computing","link":"/en/computing","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Servers","link":"/en/computing/iaas","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"39505792-9082-4c48-b2dc-00301b2d219d","title":"Network in a Linux VM","data":"This guide provides recommendations for troubleshooting network configuration issues on Linux VMs.\n\nAs an example, it is assumed that:\n\na virtual machine has only one network interface;\nthe problem of missing access to the virtual machine via SSH is being solved.\n\nThe described approaches can also be used when access is lost to another application (for example, NGINX web server) or when a virtual machine has multiple network interfaces.\n\nExample of a problem\n\nIt is not possible to connect to a VM via SSH at its private IP address or floating IP address (if there is one).\nSome time ago there were no problems with the connection.\n\nBefore starting work\n\nPerform a forced reboot.\n\n   This operation can help if the VM is not responding or its network interface is initialized incorrectly:\n   Stop VM.\n   For a stopped VM run forced reboot.\n\n   If this does not solve the problem, follow the remaining steps and proceed to diagnostics.\n\nMake sure, that the VM is running.\n\nMake sure,that you can access the virtual machine console and sign in.\n\n   If necessary, restore password for authorization.\n\nGet information about the configuration of the virtual machine network interface:\n\n   Go to management console VK Cloud.\n   Select the project where the necessary VM is located.\n   Go to Cloud Servers → Virtual machines.\n   Click on the name of the required VM.\n   Go to the tab Networks.\n   Write down the following network information:\n\n      network and subnet names;\n      gateway and subnet CIDR;\n      IP address: private and floating (if any);\n      MAC address;\n      Firewall settings (list of security groups).\n\n      For example, the following values will be used:\n\n       Parameter                                            Value                 \n          \n       Network name                                         demoNetwork         \n       Name of subnet                                       demoSubnet          \n       Gateway                                              10.0.0.1            \n       CIDR                                                 10.0.0.0/24         \n       Private IP address                                   10.0.0.5            \n       Private IP address in combination with a prefix from CIDR  10.0.0.5/24         \n       Floating IP                                          192.0.2.22          \n       MAC address                                          fa:16:3e:aa:bb:cc   \n       Firewall settings                                    default             \n\n\n1.

If access does not appear, go to the application check.\n\n2. Make sure that the necessary applications are running on the VM\n\nThe network interface may be fine, but applications and services may not be running or running on a nonstandard port.\n\nCheck the SSH operation:\n\nConnect to the virtual machine console and sign in.\n\nRun the command:\n\n        sudo systemctl status ssh\n\n    By the output of the command, determine whether the service is running:\n\n    Active: active (running): SSH service is running.\n    Active: inactive (dead): SSH service is not running.\n\nDepending on the SSH service status, follow these steps:\n\n    If SSH service is running\n    If SSH service is not running\n\n\n    Determine which port the SSH service is running on:\n\n              sudo cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config  grep w Port\n\n       The output will contain the port number:\n\n              Port 22\n\n        If the service is running on a standard port 22 — go to checking the settings of the VM firewall. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.\n\n    Connect using a nonstandard port number. For example, if the SSH service is running on a port 222:\n\n                ssh i /path/to/private_key_file username@192.0.2.22 p 222\n\n    Check for SSH access to the VM. If access has not appeared, proceed to checking the settings of the VM firewall.\n\n\n    Determine which port the SSH service is running on:\n\n                sudo cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config  grep w Port\n\n        The output will contain the port number:\n\n                Port 22\n\n    Make sure that other processes are not using this port. View SSH service logs:\n\n                sudo journalctl xeu ssh\n\n        If there is a similar string in the logs, then the SSH service port is used by another process:\n\n                error: Bind to port 22 on 0.0.0.0 failed: Address already in use.\n\n        If there is no such line in the logs, proceed to checking the settings of the VM firewall.\n\n    Determine which process took up the port:\n\n        Install the netstat utility:\n\n            Debian, Ubuntu\n            AlmaLinux, CentOS\n\n\n                        sudo apt install nettools y\n\n\n                        sudo yum install nettools y\n\n\n        Run the command:\n\n                        sudo netstat plntu  grep :22\n\n            In this output example, port 22 is used by the someotherservice process with the PID 1234:\n\n                        tcp   0   0 0.0.0.0:22   0.0.0.0:*  LISTEN   1234/someotherservice\n            tcp6  0   0 :::22        :::*       LISTEN   1234/someotherservice\n\n    Stop the process using the SSH port:\n\n        or using systemctl:\n\n                        sudo systemctl stop someotherservice\n\n        or by forcibly shutting down the process:\n\n                        sudo kill 1234\n\n    Change the settings of the service corresponding to the stopped process so that the service uses a port other than 22.\n\n    Restart the service:\n\n                sudo systemctl restart someotherservice\n\n    Restart SSH service:\n\n                sudo systemctl restart sshd\n\n    Make sure that the SSH service is running successfully:\n\n                sudo systemctl status sshd\n\n        Example of the output part:\n\n                Active: active (running)\n\n        If the SSH service does not start, check the service settings in the configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config.\n        For more information about problems with the service, see the logs:\n\n                sudo journalctl xeu ssh\n\n    Check for SSH access to the VM. If access has not appeared, proceed to checking the settings of the VM firewall.\n\n\n3. Check the settings of the virtual machine firewall\n\nIf a firewall is configured on a virtual machine (for example, iptables, ufw, firewalld), it may prevent connection, even if the IP address of the virtual machine is correct, and the SSH service is configured and running.\n\nNext, it will be shown how to temporarily disable all firewall rules, allowing all traffic. This will help to make sure that the problem is in the firewall.\n\n\n\nAfter the SSH connection problem is localized, enable the firewall rules back (with the necessary adjustments). If all traffic is allowed, the security of the VM will decrease.\n\n\n\nTo check the firewall settings:\n\nConnect to the virtual machine console and sign in.\n\nDisable the firewall:\n\n    ufw\n    firewalld\n    iptables\n\n\n        sudo ufw disable\n\n\n        sudo systemctl stop firewalld\n\n\n    Save the existing rules iptables:\n\n                sudo iptablessave  sudo tee ~/iptables.rules\n\n    Run the commands:\n\n                sudo iptables P INPUT ACCEPT\n        sudo iptables P FORWARD ACCEPT\n        sudo iptables P OUTPUT ACCEPT\n        sudo iptables t nat F\n        sudo iptables t mangle F\n        sudo iptables F\n        sudo iptables X\n\n\nCheck for SSH access to the VM.\n\n   If access has appeared, adjust the firewall rules and enable it again.\n\n   If access does not appear, turn on the firewall again and check the settings of the VK Cloud firewall security groups.\n\nTo turn on the firewall again:\n\nConnect to the virtual machine console and sign in.\n\nRun the command:\n\n    ufw\n    firewalld\n    iptables\n\n\n        sudo ufw enable\n\n\n        sudo systemctl start firewalld\n\n\n        sudo iptablesrestore\n\n\n4. Check the settings of the VK Cloud firewall security groups\n\nIncorrectly configured security groups can prevent SSH connection, even if there are no obstacles at the VM level.\n\nNext, it will be shown how to temporarily configure the firewall rules so as to allow all traffic. This will help to make sure that the problem is in the firewall.\n\n\n\nAfter the SSH connection problem is localized, reconfigure the firewall rules (with the necessary adjustments). If all traffic is allowed, the security of the VM will decrease.\n\n\n\nTo check the firewall settings:\n\nGo to management console VK Cloud.\nSelect the project where the necessary VM is located.\nGo to Cloud Servers → Virtual machines.\nClick on the name of the required VM.\nGo to the tab Networks.\nClick   for the required network connection and select Edit connection.\nIn the Firewall settings parameter:\n\n    Delete all selected security groups.\n    Select security groups from the dropdown list default and all («All allowed»).\n\n       The default security group allows any outgoing traffic. The all security group allows any incoming traffic.\n\nClick the Save button.\n\nCheck for SSH access to the VM.\n\n    If access has appeared, adjust the firewall security groups and add them again instead of the all group.\n\n    If access does not appear, go back to the original firewall settings and contact technical support.\n\nTo configure firewall rules again:\n\nGo to management console VK Cloud.\nSelect the project where the necessary VM is located.\nGo to Cloud Servers → Virtual machines.\nClick on the name of the required VM.\nGo to the tab Networks.\nClick   for the required network connection and select Edit connection.\nIn the Firewall settings parameter:\n\n    Delete the security group all.\n    Select the necessary security groups from the dropdown list.\n\n        If the selected security groups do not contain rules that allow outgoing traffic, also select the default security group. This group allows outgoing traffic. Otherwise, the virtual machine will not have access to the network.\n\n\n    In order for the firewall to pass the traffic of an SSH service running on the standard port 22, it is enough to select the rules default and ssh («only ssh allowed»).\n\n\n5.

If the machine has already been created, change its type.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to track VM performance?\n\nOn the tab Monitoring on the page of the created VM.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does VM scaling work?\n\nScaling a VK Cloud virtual machine goes through the steps:\n\nVM stops.\nCPU, RAM, or HDD are added to the virtual machine.\nThe VM is being restarted.\n\nBilling iteration occurs once an hour — during this time, the calculation of the cost of resources will change.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I set a floating IP address for a VM?\n\nYou can assign an existing floating IP address to the VM, or add a new address manually.\n\n\n\nThe assignment of a new floating IP address occurs randomly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between VPS and VDS?\n\nThere is no visible difference.\n\nProviders offer one service in a complex — the rental of a virtual VPS/VDS server. Choose how many and what resources are needed for the operation of web services: the number of processors, storage sizes, type of drives, operating systems and other parameters. The provider will make sure that you receive them in full upon request.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is virtualization implemented?\n\nThe provider deploys a virtualization environment on physical servers, in which there are many VM clients. VMs are isolated from each other, clients access them remotely through encrypted connections. VK Cloud implements virtualization based on KVM + OpenStack with its own improvements.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to change the configuration of the cloud server after connection?\n\nYes, you can. This process is accompanied by a reboot of the virtual machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to place a VM and a disk in different data centers to increase fault tolerance?\n\nIt is highly not recommended to place a virtual machine and disks to it in different data centers, as this may affect the stability and performance of the VM as a whole. When creating a VM, place the disk and VM in the same availability zone.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do writeoffs continue, even though the VM is stopped?\n\nIf the VM is stopped, then writeoffs continue for the following services:\n\nuse of licenses (Windows and RDS, if activated);\ndisk space rental;\nstorage of existing backups.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do VPS/VDS cloud servers differ from dedicated servers?\n\nFrom the user's point of view, servers in the cloud are no different from a dedicated physical one: you also get root rights, access to network settings, can perform any actions on files, install and configure any necessary software.\n\nTo get full control over the cost of the service, it is better to rent a VPS/VDS. You can create or destroy VMs in minutes, depending on current needs, increase or decrease their power without stopping (without downtime). Dedicated servers do not have the flexibility that a cloud VPS/VDS has, which leads to underutilization of resources and the risk of applications crashing at peak loads.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy can't my VMs in VK Cloud see my network outside the cloud?\n\nNetwork connection (VPN) must be configured between the networks. Learn more about creating a VPN between the VK Cloud network and an external network in the article Setting up a VPN tunnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many times can I create and delete virtual machines?\n\nThe operation of creating and deleting resources can be performed an unlimited number of times.\n\nDisks and images\n\n\n\nHow do I increase the disk?\n\nYou can enlarge the disk using the VK Cloud panel in the Virtual Machines or Disks section of the Cloud Servers service.\n\nFull information is available in the article about disk expansion.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnable to shrink disk\n\nIn the VK Cloud platform, only an increase in the disk size is available.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is my disk running slowly?\n\nDisk performance may be affected by factors:\n\nbackground processes of the operating system;\nmechanisms of backup operation;\nautomatic updates (relevant for Windows);\nrunning thirdparty software.\n\nIf these factors are missing, collect disk performance statistics using one of the following methods:\n\ndisk utilization — using utility iostat;\nload average — using utility top.\n\nCompare the obtained indicators with the guaranteed disk performance provided by the VK Cloud platform. If there are significant deviations, contact technical support.\n\n\n\nTo increase performance, you can increase the size or change disk type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the migration process affect disk performance?\n\nAt the time of migration, there may be a decrease in readonly performance, but usually there is a sufficient margin for reading performance, and the decrease is imperceptible.\n\n\n\n\n\nI can't delete a disk\n\nMake sure that the disk is disabled from VM — after that, delete the disk in the Cloud Servers → Disks section.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I transfer a VM disk to another project?\n\nUse the instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I upload my OS image?\n\nThe VK Cloud platform allows the creation of virtual machines from previously prepared and uploaded images. Image preparation consists of installing the necessary set of software components and drivers to work in cloud provider services, for more details in the articles HyperV VM Migration to VK Cloud and VMware VM Migration to VK Cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I change the VM's root disk?\n\nReplacement of the root disk is possible only if another disk has already been created in the VK Cloud project. It can be either an empty disk or a boot disk containing the operating system. Instructions are given in the article about replacing the root disk.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to create a disk snapshot?\n\nCreating a disk snapshot is available from VK Cloud management console or OpenStack CLI. The created snapshot will be stored until the disk itself is deleted.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I restore a disk from a snapshot?\n\nUse the instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow fast does the disk type change?\n\nThe disk type changes at the following rate:\n\n70MB/s: if the disk is connected to the VM.\n250MB/s: if the disk is disconnected from the VM.\n\nYou cannot change the type of disk attached to a disabled VM.\n\n\n\n\n\nAre copies of disks stored after conversion to another data center?\n\nWhen converting a disk to another data center, a mirror is created into which the data of the original disk is loaded. After conversion, such mirrors are not saved.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to expand all disks at once, or does each need to be expanded separately?\n\nYou can expand all disks at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWill the VM be rebooted when the disk size changes?\n\nThe VM disk size changes during operation, without restarting the VM.\n\nFile storage\n\n\n\nWhat is file storage intended for?\n\nNetwork file storage that operates over the NFS or CIFS protocol is designed for sharing resources.\n\nThis service allows you to create a remote file system, mount the file system on virtual machines, and then read and write data from instances to and from the file system.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to use an SSD drive instead of HDD when creating an NFS file storage?\n\nNo, such possibility is not provided.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to use file storage between projects?\n\nNo, such functionality is not provided.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to restore file storage from a snapshot?\n\nYes, there is such a possibility. In this case, the storage will be restored to a separate VM, this will require additional quotas.\n\nLearn more about creating snapshots in the article File Storage management.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to create snapshots of the file storage on a schedule?\n\nNo, there is no such possibility.\n\nA snapshot of the file storage can be created manually via management console VK Cloud or using the API.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo file storages have any agents to control free space?\n\nNo, there are no such agents.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to use file storage over the SCSI protocol?\n\nWork with this protocol is not provided.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to connect file storage via VPN in another cloud?\n\nThere is no such possibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the maximum amount of file storage?\n\nThe maximum amount of file storage is 50TB.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn which availability zone are file storages created?\n\nRepositories are created in availability zones GZ1 (Moscow region) and QAZ (Kazakhstan region).\nAvailability zones of repositories depend on the region of the project:\n\nGZ1 for Moscow region;\nQAZ for Kazakhstan region.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to configure simultaneous access from different VMs to the file storage?\n\nYes, you can, for more information, see the article File Storage management.\n\nLicensing\n\n\n\nHow do I get a Windows Server license?\n\nA licensed copy of the Windows Server operating system is preinstalled in the Windowsbased VM being created. Activation of the licensed copy occurs automatically after the VM is created. If an OS activation error occurs, contact technical support with the virtual machine ID.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat licenses can I get?\n\nThe list of standard licenses provided is limited, you can see the list available in the price list.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat types of licensing are there?\n\nMicrosoft provides several licensing models that allow you to make the most optimal use of your budget:\n\nTo the core. This licensing model provides access to an unlimited number of users or devices.\nPer user. It is designed to provide access to the license to one user for an unlimited number of servers.\n\nAccording to Microsoft licensing rules, the “per core” option implies the need to cover each VM virtual core with a license. Regardless of the number of VM cores, licenses are subject to every 2 virtual CPUs, for more information, see the article Microsoft.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I get a discount?\n\nThere are no discounts on licensing.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I use my license?\n\nYes, learn more about using your own licenses.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I buy a license on an indefinite basis?\n\nVK Cloud provides license rentals on a monthly basis. The purchase of a license for permanent use, both on the VK Cloud platform and outside it, is not possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much does an RDS license cost?\n\nThe cost of the license is given in the price list.\n\n\n","url":"/en/computing/iaas/faq","categoryPartialPath":"/en/computing","description":"Answers to frequently asked questions about the Cloud Servers service.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Computing","link":"/en/computing","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Servers","link":"/en/computing/iaas","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"b2a6e660-59c6-4de3-be83-e09aac1fb14e","title":"About service","data":"What tasks does\n\nMachine learning\n\nNVIDIA® Tesla® GPUs are great for training and inferencing deep neural networks with high performance.\n\nThe available GPU:\n\nA100 40GB\nA100 80GB\nV100 16GB\nV100S 32GB\nA30 24GB\nL40S 48GB\n\nHigh Performance Computing (HPC)\n\nThe solution of tasks that require large computing power is easier to carry out using cloud computing on the GPU.

For successful integration with a VDI environment, a VPN tunnel can be organized using a dedicated VPN server based on an IaaS VM (virtual machine). This will allow you to organize secure connectivity up to the CIDR specified in the VDI settings.\n\nTo show how to configure a secure connection with virtual desktops:\n\nA VPN tunnel will be created between the LDAP environment and the VDI environment in VK Cloud.\nOn the LDAP side, the builtin VK Cloud VPN service will be used as a VPN solution.

This simplifies the migration of workloads to the VK Cloud, eliminating new costs for the purchase of Microsoft licenses. This advantage is available to Microsoft corporate licensing customers with licenses of the relevant applications under the current Microsoft Software Assurance (SA) agreements.\n\nChecking a previously purchased license\n\nTo transfer licenses under the Software Assurance agreement, you must go through the license verification process, and Microsoft must confirm that you have eligible licenses in accordance with the current Software Assurance (SA) agreement. Fill out the verification form on the corporate Licensing website and provide it to your Microsoft representative or partner who will help send it to Microsoft:\n\nemail: support@mcs.mail.ru;\nname of the partner: VK Cloud;\npartner web site: cloud.vk.com.\n\nAfter receiving the form, Microsoft will check your license and inform you and your Microsoft partner about the results of the check. Further instructions in the manual Moving licenses within Software Assurance and to the document License Mobility Verification Guide Microsoft (PDF).\n\nAccording to the requirements of the agreement, you are responsible for performing inspections and extensions. However, you can start deploying application server software without waiting for the verification to be completed. You can deploy the software ten days before submitting the form.\n\nAfter passing the verification process, let us know about it to support service, indicating the name of the project and the type of license used.\n\nLicense transfer conditions\n\nTo use the license transfer, ensure that the conditions are met:\n\nAll Microsoft Server application software products migrated to VK Cloud using Software Assurance license portability must be subject to the current Software Assurance (SA) agreement.\n\nServer applications should be included in the list of eligible products:\n\n    Exchange Server;\n    SharePoint Server;\n    SQL Server Standard Edition;\n    SQL Server Enterprise Edition;\n    SQL Server Business Intelligence Edition;\n    Skype for Business Server;\n    System Center Server;\n    Dynamics CRM Server;\n    Dynamics AX Server;\n    Project Server;\n    Visual Studio Team Foundation Server;\n    BizTalk Server;\n    Forefront Identity Manager;\n    Forefront Unified Access Gateway;\n    Remote Desktop Services.\n\n    The full list of eligible software products is available in the Microsoft Product Terms of Use.\n\nEligible corporate licensing programs include Enterprise Agreement, Enterprise Subscription Agreement and Microsoft Open Value Agreement, which include the Software Assurance agreement, as well as other Microsoft corporate licensing programs in which the Software Assurance agreement is an additional feature, for example, Microsoft Open License or Select Plus.\n\nTo access the application servers, you must have the appropriate Client Access Licenses (CAL) in the corporate licensing agreement together with the Software Assurance agreement.\n\nLicense portability does not apply to Microsoft Windows client operating systems, desktop application products (for example, Microsoft Office) and Microsoft Windows Server operating systems.\n\nIn accordance with the rules of the Microsoft Server farm, licenses deployed in a specific VK Cloud region cannot be transferred to another VK Cloud region within 90 days.

There are two types of routers in VK Cloud:\n\nA standard router is designed to route traffic between VK Cloud subnets, and to provide access to the external network from such subnets.\n\n  It also routes traffic between VK Cloud subnets and the remote site if a VPN tunnel is used.\n\nAn advanced router is designed to route traffic between VK Cloud subnets and subnets at the remote site.\n\n  It is used if a network junction is created between VK Cloud and the remote site via the Cloud Direct Connect service.\n\n\n  The Cloud Direct Connect service is connected on request.\n\n\n  Sprut SDN is required for an advanced router to operate. Any VK Cloud subnets can be connected to such a router, regardless of which SDN these subnets belong to.\n\nDifferent types of routers can be used within a single VK Cloud subnet.\n\nStandard router capabilities\n\nRouting traffic between VK Cloud subnets.**\n\n  A special OpenStack port for the INTERFACE_DISTRIBUTED device is used as the default gateway in any subnet connected to the router. This port is the router's interface on the subnet and is assigned the IP address specified in the subnet settings as the gateway address.\n\n  You can also configure static routing. For example, direct traffic to a virtual machine that acts as a dedicated firewall or other network device.\n\nProviding access from VK Cloud subnets to the external network.**\n\n  A router connected to the external network provides additional capabilities for subnets:\n\n  Internet access for an OpenStack port on the subnet.\n\n    For example, you can provide Internet access to a virtual machine so that it can receive updates. However, this virtual machine will not be accessible from the internet.\n\n    To allow the port to access the internet, the private IP address of the port is translated to the public IP address of the router using the Source NAT (SNAT) mechanism. The translation is performed through the router's dedicated interface on the subnet, a special SNAT port that is assigned a random IP address from the DHCP address pool.\n\n  The ability to assign a floating IP address to an OpenStack port on the subnet.\n\n    If a floating IP address is assigned to an OpenStack port, that port not only accesses the Internet, but also becomes accessible from the Internet. For example, you can assign a public IP address to a port assigned to a virtual machine to connect to it from the internet via SSH.\n\n    To provide access to and from the internet, the private IP address of the port is translated to a floating IP address using the 1to1 NAT mechanism.\n\n  Organization of a VPN tunnel between networks in projects with SDN Neutron.\n\n    This allows you to create a secure channel for managing the VK Cloud infrastructure or transferring data between the company network and VK Cloud networks.\n\nAdvanced router capabilities\n\nConnecting to a network junction between VK Cloud and a remote site.**\n\n  Such a junction is organized with the help of Cloud Direct Connect service. After connecting and configuring the service, a new subnet will be added to the VK Cloud project. Parameters of this subnet can be set by you or telecom provider. This subnet is the network junction, so an advanced router must have a configured interface in this subnet.\n\nRouting traffic between VK Cloud subnets and subnets on the remote site.**\n\n  Both static routing and dynamic routing using (via BGP) can be configured to route traffic.\n\n  The following rules apply when configuring BGP peering between an advanced router and a remote router at the remote site:\n\n  BGP peering must be performed over a Direct Connect network junction.\n  Only private Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) from the range 6451265534 may be used.\n  On the side of both the advanced and remote router, it is allowed to announce only the prefixes of private subnets that are not routable in the internet.\n\n  Also on the advanced router side, the following BGP timers values are set:\n\n  Hold timer: 240 seconds.\n  Keepalive timer: 80 seconds (hold timer / 3).\n\n\n  The mismatch of these timers values on both BGP routers does not affect the forming of neighbor relationships.\n\n\nOrganization of a VPN tunnel between remote networks and networks in projects with SDN Sprut.**\n\n   VPN tunnels in projects with SDN Sprut are created based on an advanced router.\n\nSupporting redundancy for fault tolerance.**\n\n  Advanced routers support VRRP protocol. Therefore, you can configure multiple routers in combination with VRRP to provide fault tolerance. If one or more routers fail, the remaining routers will continue to handle traffic that arrives at the IP address specified as the default gateway address when configuring VRRP.\n","url":"/en/networks/vnet/concepts/router","categoryPartialPath":"/en/networks","description":"How to use a router to connect different networks with each other.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Networks and content delivery","link":"/en/networks","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Networks","link":"/en/networks/vnet","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"cb778b44-2c4c-46fe-b945-cf6fd5968fab","title":"Traffic restriction","data":"Using IP Source Guard\n\nFor OpenStack ports, you can specify a list of IP addresses to use IP Source Guard.\nOnly traffic whose source IP address is on this list will be sent through the port.

This can be useful when the virtual machine is involved in processing traffic and is an intermediate network node (such as a router, firewall or VPN gateway).\n\nUse of firewall and security groups\n\nA firewall can be used to restrict traffic on virtual networks.\n\nThe firewall handles traffic according to defined security groups. These groups contain rules for handling inbound and outbound traffic and operate according to the \"anything not allowed is denied\" principle.

In this way, a subnet and external IP address will be automatically assigned to it.\nConnect the VM to a private subnet that is connected to a router with access to an external network, and assign it a floating IP address. In this way, the IP address can be set manually or automatically.\n\nFloating IP address\n\nA floating IP address (DNAT) is a static IP address that can be dynamically reassigned between resources in a cloud environment. Floating IP is used through SDN, which allows the network administrator to move IP addresses between devices without having to change the physical or virtual network configuration. This allows you to switch traffic between different servers without changing the configuration of the servers themselves.\n\nFloating IP addresses are used for:\n\nEnsuring fault tolerance — if the primary server fails, the IP address can be quickly redirected to the backup server, minimizing downtime.\n\nLoad balancing — floating IP addresses can be used to distribute traffic across multiple servers, thereby increasing system performance and reliability.\n\nFlexible network reconfiguration — in environments with frequently changing requirements, floating IP addresses allow you to quickly redistribute resources without the need to change IP addressing and associated settings.\n\nPublic IP address pool of the internet external network\n\nAll projects in SDN Sprut are connected to the external network internet.\n\nOn all subnets of the external network internet:\n\nDHCP is disabled;\nDNS servers 5.61.237.120 and 5.61.237.127 are used.\n\n\n Subnet name   Subnet address    Available IP address range                          Gateway         \n        \n extsub   89.208.216.0/24   89.208.216.1  89.208.216.253                        89.208.216.254 \n extsub2   212.111.84.0/22   212.111.84.1  212.111.87.253                         212.111.87.254 \n\nPublic IP address pool of the extnet external network\n\nAll projects in SDN Neutron are connected to an external network extnet.\n\nOn all subnets of the external network extnet:\n\nDHCP is disabled;\nDNS servers 5.61.237.120 and 5.61.237.127 are used.\n\n\n Subnet name   Subnet address    Available IP address range                          Gateway         \n        \n extsubnet1   95.163.248.0/22   95.163.248.10—95.163.251.250                        95.163.251.254  \n extsubnet2   79.137.174.0/23   79.137.174.5—79.137.175.253                         79.137.175.254  \n extsubnet4   95.163.212.0/22   95.163.212.1—95.163.215.253                         95.163.215.254  \n extsubnet5   95.163.208.0/22   95.163.208.1—95.163.211.253                         95.163.211.254  \n extsubnet6   95.163.180.0/23   95.163.180.1—95.163.181.253                         95.163.181.254  \n extsubnet7   89.208.84.0/22    89.208.84.1—89.208.87.253                           89.208.87.254   \n extsubnet8   89.208.196.0/22   89.208.196.1—89.208.199.253                         89.208.199.254  \n extsubnet9   95.163.182.0/23   95.163.182.1—95.163.183.253                         95.163.183.254  \n extsubnet10  85.192.32.0/22    85.192.32.1—85.192.35.253                           85.192.35.254   \n extsubnet11  89.208.208.0/22   89.208.208.1—89.208.211.253                         89.208.211.254  \n extsubnet12  89.208.220.0/22   89.208.220.1—89.208.223.253                         89.208.223.254  \n extsubnet13  213.219.212.0/22  213.219.212.1—213.219.215.253                       213.219.215.254 \n extsubnet14  89.208.228.0/22   89.208.228.1—89.208.231.253                         89.208.231.254  \n extsubnet15  185.241.192.0/22  185.241.192.1—185.241.195.253                       185.241.195.254 \n extsubnet17  87.239.104.0/21   87.239.104.1—87.239.111.253                         87.239.111.254  \n extsubnet18  185.86.144.0/22   185.86.144.1—185.86.147.253                         185.86.147.254  \n extsubnet19  37.139.32.0/22    37.139.32.1—37.139.35.253                           37.139.35.254   \n extsubnet20  37.139.40.0/22    37.139.40.1—37.139.43.253                           37.139.43.254   \n extsubnet21  146.185.240.0/22  146.185.240.1—146.185.243.253                       146.185.243.254 \n extsubnet22  5.188.140.0/22    5.188.140.1—5.188.143.253                           5.188.143.254   \n extsubnet23  146.185.208.0/22  146.185.208.1—146.185.211.253                       146.185.211.254 \n extsubnet24  84.23.52.0/22     84.23.52.1—84.23.55.253                             84.23.55.254    \n extsubnet25  109.120.180.0/22  109.120.180.1—109.120.183.253                       109.120.183.254 \n extsubnet26  109.120.188.0/22  109.120.188.1—109.120.191.253                       109.120.191.254 \n extsubnet27  185.130.112.0/22  185.130.112.1—185.130.115.253                       185.130.115.254 \n extsubnet28  94.139.244.0/22   94.139.245.0—94.139.247.253                         94.139.247.254  \n extsubnet29  212.233.88.0/21   212.233.88.1—212.233.95.253                         212.233.95.254  \n\n","url":"/en/networks/vnet/concepts/ips-and-inet","categoryPartialPath":"/en/networks","description":"How IP address management and internet access are organized.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Networks and content delivery","link":"/en/networks","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Networks","link":"/en/networks/vnet","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"e7d18536-a3c8-4f2c-8189-5b25d9935a68","title":"Networks and subnets","data":"In addition to the cloud network, you can create subnets.

This address is used to organize faulttolerant processing of incoming traffic by these virtual machines. The technology works like this: a VIP is assigned to one of the cluster virtual machines that processes traffic from this VIP. Clients accessing this address will be directed to this virtual machine. If the virtual machine fails, then the VIP will be transferred to another virtual machine from the cluster, and traffic processing will continue. Virtual machines monitor their state and manage VIP assignment using the VRRP protocol (https://www.rfceditor.org/rfc/rfc3768).\n\nTo show the virtual IP address setting:\n\ntwo virtual machines will be created for which:\n  a virtual IP address will be created;\n  VRRP will be configured in the keepalived implementation to serve this IP address.\na third virtual machine with a floating IP address will be created, from which all the necessary settings and health check will be performed.\n\nScenario DiagramparamsnoBordertrue\n\n1.

If one or more servers fail, traffic will be redirected to the remaining servers. Also the separate type of load balancer is used to power other VK Cloud platform services.\n\nThe VK Cloud platform load balancer is based on OpenStack Octavia, which has HAProxy at its core. OpenStack Octavia gives the balancer the following capabilities:\n\nProxying and balancing HTTP, HTTPS, UDP and TCPconnections (the latter including proxyprotocol support).\n\n  Proxy protocol when using the TCP protocol allows you to pass information about connections (such as the client's IP address) to the server. For the server to be able to process such information, it must itself support this protocol. The Proxy protocol is supported by NGINX, Apache, Envoy and other products.\n\nProxying and balancing HTTP/2 connections in addition to HTTP/1.1.\n\nTerminating SSL connections on the balancer.\n\nFine tune timeouts.\n\nDifferent balancing methods.\n\nAdjustment of weights for backends.\n\nFor fault tolerance, two instances of the balancer are supported, one in active mode and one in standby mode. State synchronization and traffic switching between these balancers takes place using the VRRP protocol. From the user's point of view this faulttolerant configuration looks like a single balancer.\n\nTo ensure maximum balancer performance:\n\nProvide keepalive connectivity to the backends over HTTP/1.1.\nUse a standard Ethernet MTU of 1500 bytes for incoming traffic to the balancer.\n\nUnder these conditions, the balancer can reach the peak performance, handling 1 to 1.5 gigabits of traffic per second and about 10,000 requests per second.\n\nTypes of load balancers\n\nThere are two types of load balancers in VK Cloud. You can see the type in management console.\n\nDifferent types of balancers are charged differently.\n\n\n\nStandard balancer\nService balancer\n\n\n\nThis balancer is usercreated and can be used to provide fault tolerance and flexible application scaling:\n\nWhen working with Cloud Servers service to distribute incoming traffic between virtual servers.\nWhen working with container service, such as when using Ingress controllers (including the preconfigured one) or services like Load Balancer.\n\n\n\n\nThis balancer is created automatically to power services and is applied:\n\nIn container service for each Kubernetes cluster to provide access to the Kubernetes API.\nIn database service for database instances in a cluster configuration to loadbalance between instance nodes.

The Proxy protocol can be used if it is supported by the servers behind the balancer.\n\n   Balancing method:\n\n     LEAST_CONNECTIONS: use the backend to which the least number of connections are established.\n     ROUND_ROBIN: go through all backends one by one.\n     SOURCE_IP: assign a backend for handling traffic to a specific client IP address.\n\n   Allowed cidrs: IP addresses or subnet addresses from which connections to the balancer are allowed. This parameter can be used to restrict access to the balancer from trusted addresses only.\n\n     If the parameter is not set, connections are allowed from any IP addresses (which is equivalent to CIDR 0.0.0.0/0).\n\n   Timeout parameters:\n\n     Client data: client inactivity timeout.\n     Member connect: backend connection timeout.\n     Member data: backend inactive timeout.\n     TCP inspect: timeout for additional TCP segments during content inspection.\n\n     The timeout values are set in milliseconds. The minimum value is 0, the maximum value is 2073600000 (576 hours).\n\n   Send XForwardedFor header (for HTTP and HTTPS balancing protocols only): an option that allows you to enable the corresponding HTTP header to be sent to the backend. By default the option is disabled.\n\n   Sticky sessions: the option provides longterm connection with the server with data saved throughout the entire session.\n\n      If the option is enabled, requests are executed between servers using the selected balancing method, but after connecting, the session is assigned to the selected server. All requests for this session will be sent to the same server, regardless of the balancing method. The session will not end until the user ends it or until the server becomes unavailable. In this case, requests will be transferred to the second server according to the balancing rules.\n\n      Field Type allows you to configure the session settings:\n\n      APPcookie: the session is determined by the cookie specified in the application code. If this option is selected, in the Cookie name field, enter the cookie that identifies the session.\n      HTTPcookie: the session is determined by the cookie that the load balancer creates during connections to the server and attaches to the session.\n      Source IP: the client’s IP address is used to bind the session to the server. Use this type only if the client's IP address does not change during the session.\n\n   Apply to the following instances: tools to select virtual machine instances that will act as backends for the balancer. You can add an instance either by selecting it from the list or by selecting the tag assigned to the instance.\n\n\n     The security groups for the selected virtual machines must be configured to allow traffic to the destination port and protocol.\n\n\n   Certificate (HTTPS balancing protocol only): the certificate to be used by the balancer to terminate the SSL connection.\n\n     You can select an existing certificate or load a new one.\n\n     When you load a new certificate, specify:\n\n     Certificate Name.\n     Certificate and chain of certificates: a public certificate or certificate chain. You can either paste it into the field in text form or load it from a file.\n     Private key: A private certificate. Can be inserted into the field in text form or loaded from a file.\n     Password: password of the private certificate (if used). You can insert it into the field in text form or load it from a file.\n\nBackend availability check options (healthcheck):\n\n   Method of checking: TCP or HTTP.\n   Interval: check interval in seconds.\n   Number of attempts: the number of times to try before the backend is deemed inaccessible.\n   Timeout: timeout in seconds, after which it is considered that the backend does not respond to the check.\n\n   The following parameters are only available for the HTTP validation type:\n\n   HTTP method: the method to use to check availability.\n   Response status: HTTP status which will make the accessibility check a success.\n   Query path: the path to use to test accessibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are just the basic command arguments.

Full cache clearance will cause CDN servers to request content from origin servers that increases the load on origins and may destabilize the service. Use selective cache clearance if you need to remove a large volume of content from the cache.\n    Selective — allows you to remove individual files from the cache of the CDN resource. In the input field, specify the path or pattern of the path to the files you want to delete.

It can help reduce the load of origin servers. Preloading is relevant for files larger than 200 MB.\n\n\n\nTo update files on a CDN, first clear a cache of the CDN resource, and then upload new.\n\n\n\nTo preload a cache of a CDN resource:\n\n\n\nManagement console\nAPI\n\n\n\ninclude(/en/_includes/_opencdn.md)\n\nUpload the content with one of the following ways:\n\n    Click   for the required resource and select Uploading to CDN.\n    Click the name of the personal domain you need and go to the Content tab.\n\nIn the Filling the cache specify the path to the files on the origin without the domain name and one per line.\nClick Fill cache.\n\n\n\n\nUse the POST /projects/project_id/resources/resources_id/prefetch method.\n\nIn the body of the request, specify paths to the files that need to be loaded, without the domain name.\n\nExample request for cache preloading of a CDN resource:\n\ncurl location request POST 'https://msk.cloud.vk.com/api/cdn/api/v1/projects/examplef8f67/resources/175281/prefetch'\\\nheader 'XAuthToken: example6UjMOd'\\\nheader 'ContentType: application/json'\\\ndata '\n    \"paths\": \n        \"/video.mp4\",\n        \"video.mp4\"\n        \n    '\n\nConfiguring HTTP response codes\n\nThe Enable returning HTTP response code option allows you to set the HTTP response code for content hosted on a CDN resource. For example, you can configure a redirection to another URL or send the 403 code to endusers when requesting certain files.\n\nTo configure the HTTP response code:\n\n\n\nManagement console\nAPI\n\n\n\ninclude(/en/_includes/_opencdn.md)\n\nGo to the Content tab.\nEnable the Enable returning HTTP response code option.\nSpecify a responce code.

The average compression ratio if this method is 70%, sometimes it can reach 90%. The minimum file size for compression is 128 bytes.\n\nWhen you use the GZip compression method, uncompressed files are requested from the origin, so the option does not work in conjunction with origin compression and large file delivery optimization.\n\nTo enable GZip compression:\n\n\n\nManagement console\nAPI\n\n\n\ninclude(/en/_includes/_opencdn.md)\n\nGo to the Content tab.\nEnable the GZip compression option.\nClick Save changes.\n\n\n\n\ninclude(/en/_includes/_api_cdn_create_change.md)\n\nSpecify the gzipOn parameters in the options block of a request body.\n\nExample request to enable GZip compression:\n\ncurl location request PUT 'https://msk.cloud.vk.com/api/cdn/api/v1/projects/examplef8f67/resources/175281'\\\nheader 'XAuthToken: example6UjMOd'\\\nheader 'ContentType: application/json'\\\ndata '\n    \"originGroup\": 267760,\n    \"originGroup_name\": \"exampleorigin\",\n    \"secondaryHostnames\": ,\n    \"options\":\n        \n        \"gzipOn\": \n            \"enabled\": true,\n            \"value\": true\n        \n    \n'\n\nBrotli compression\n\nFiles arriving at a CDN resource can be compressed using the Brotli method. This method provides stronger compression than GZip. For instance, for text files, Brotli compression exceeds GZip by an average of 20%. The minimum file size for compression is 128 bytes.\n\nWhen using the Brotli compression method, uncompressed files are requested from the origin, and compression occurs on a special precache server. The precache server stands between the origin server and the CDN servers, protecting the origin server from high load. Origin server protection using a precache server (shielding) is a paid option. To enable it, contact technical support.\n\nThe option does not work in conjunction with origin compression and large file delivery optimization.\n\nTo enable Brotli compression:\n\n\n\nManagement console\nAPI\n\n\n\ninclude(/en/_includes/_opencdn.md)\n\nGo to the Content tab.\nEnable the Enable Brotli compression option.\nSelect the data types of the content to be compressed. The type text/html is selected by default and cannot be removed from the list.\nClick Save changes.\n\n\n\n\ninclude(/en/_includes/_api_cdn_create_change.md)\n\nSpecify the brotli_compression parameters in the options block of a request body.\n\nExample request to set up Brotli compression:\n\ncurl location request PUT 'https://msk.cloud.vk.com/api/cdn/api/v1/projects/examplef8f67/resources/175281'\\\nheader 'XAuthToken: example6UjMOd'\\\nheader 'ContentType: application/json'\\\ndata '\n    \"originGroup\": 267760,\n    \"originGroup_name\": \"exampleorigin\",\n    \"secondaryHostnames\": ,\n    \"options\":\n        \n        \"brotli_compression\": \n            \"enabled\": true,\n            \"value\": \n                \"text/html\",\n                \"application/xml+rss\",\n                \"application/xml\"\n            \n        \n    \n'\n\nOrigin compression\n\nContent compression at the origin accelerates content delivery: the content is transferred to the CDN server in compressed form, reducing data transmission time. For the option to work correctly, the origin must support compression.\n\nThe option does not work in conjunction with GZip compression, Brotli compression and large file delivery optimization.\n\nTo have a CDN resource request compressed content from an origin:\n\n\n\nManagement console\nAPI\n\n\n\ninclude(/en/_includes/_opencdn.md)\n\nGo to the Content tab.\nEnable the Request compression at source option.\nClick Save changes.\n\n\n\n\ninclude(/en/_includes/_api_cdn_create_change.md)\n\nSpecify the fetch_compressed parameters in the options block of a request body.\n\nExample request to set up compression at an origin:\n\ncurl location request PUT 'https://msk.cloud.vk.com/api/cdn/api/v1/projects/examplef8f67/resources/175281'\\\nheader 'XAuthToken: example6UjMOd'\\\nheader 'ContentType: application/json'\\\ndata '\n    \"originGroup\": 267760,\n    \"originGroup_name\": \"exampleorigin\",\n    \"secondaryHostnames\": ,\n    \"options\":\n        \n        \"fetch\": \n            \"enabled\": true,\n            \"value\": true\n        \n    \n'\n\nLarge file delivery optimization\n\nTo optimize delivery, large files are transferred from an origin to a CDN resource and stored in a cache not in full, but in parts of 10 MB each. The CDN resource will start transferring the file to users sooner and will also be able to transfer the file in parts to multiple users simultaneously.\n\nFor the option to work correctly, the origin must support HTTP Range requests. If an origin group is used for the resource, the files on each of the origins used must contain identical ContentLength and ETag headers.\n\nAfter enabling or disabling the option, caching keys will change, and content will be requested from the origin again.\n\n\n\nTo reduce the load on the origin, manage the option during offpeak hours and contact technical support to protect the origin with a precache server.\n\n\n\nThe option does not work in conjunction with GZip compression, Brotli compression and  origin compression.\n\nTo enable the optimization of large file delivery:\n\n\n\nManagement console\nAPI\n\n\n\ninclude(/en/_includes/_opencdn.md)\n\nGo to the Content tab.\nEnable the Enable Large File Delivery Optimization option.\nClick Save changes.\n\n\n\n\ninclude(/en/_includes/_api_cdn_create_change.md)\n\nSpecify the slice parameters in the options block of a request body.\n\nExample request to set up large file delivery optimization:\n\ncurl location request PUT 'https://msk.cloud.vk.com/api/cdn/api/v1/projects/examplef8f67/resources/175281'\\\nheader 'XAuthToken: example6UjMOd'\\\nheader 'ContentType: application/json'\\\ndata '\n    \"originGroup\": 267760,\n    \"originGroup_name\": \"exampleorigin\",\n    \"secondaryHostnames\": ,\n    \"options\":\n        \n        \"slice\": \n            \"enabled\": true,\n            \"value\": true\n        \n    \n'\n\n\n\n","url":"/en/networks/cdn/service-management/manage-cdn/content-settings","categoryPartialPath":"/en/networks","description":"How to clear or preload a CDN resource cache, configure compression, optimize content delivery, configure response codes.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Networks and content delivery","link":"/en/networks","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"CDN","link":"/en/networks/cdn","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"c63e3589-b838-4a0a-8421-8cf636a7f9a9","title":"Access setting","data":"Configuring Allowed HTTP Methods\n\nThe Allowed HTTP Methods option enables control over permitted HTTP request methods to a CDN resource.

By default, two NS entries will be set in the zone. These records are installed on the side of the domain name owner in order to transfer domain management rights to the VK Cloud name server.\nCNAME is a DNS record that binds an alias to a domain name. It is usually used to bind a subdomain (for example, www) to the domain where the content of this subdomain is hosted.\nMX is a DNS record that tells the address of the server that processes email.\nSRV is a DNS record that defines the host name and server port for some network services.\nTXT is a DNS record that contains text information for sources outside the domain.\n\nTo add a resource record:\n\n\n\nManagement console\nAPI\n\n\n\nGo to VK Cloud management console.\nSelect the project.\nGo to DNS → DNS zones.\nClick on the name of the zone for which you want to add a resource record.\nClick the button Add record.\nFill in the fields depending on the value Record type:\n\n    CNAME\n\n   Name (the alias being added):\n\n     @, example.com or an empty value — indicates the zone itself;\n     subzone or subzone.example.com — indicates a subzone subzone;\n     \\*.dns.zone — indicates any name in the domain request.\n\n   Time to live (TTL): cache lifetime in seconds.\n   Value: FQDN is the destination address (where the alias being added points to).

If no ASN is assigned, use a number from the range 64512–65534 — these numbers can be assigned for private autonomous networks. In the case the following numbers will be used:\n\n65512 for customernet;\n64512 for vkcloudnet.\n\nTo configure dynamic routes for advancedrouter:\n\nIn your management console, go to Virtual networks → Routers.\nClick the added advanced router and go to the Dynamic routing tab.\nClick Create a BGP router.\nFill in parameters:\n\n   Name: toMikroTik;\n   Router ID: 172.20.2.215;\n   ASN: 64512.\n\nClick Create.\nClick the added BGP router and go to the BGP neighbors tab.\nAdd a BGP neighbor. Fill in parameters:\n\n   Name: MikroTik;\n   Remote neighbor: 172.20.2.204;\n   Remote ASN: 65512.\n\nClick Create.\n\nMake sure the router has established a connection with its neighbor: the marker next to the name is green and BFD is enabled.\n\nThe advanced router will start broadcasting BGP announcements to its neighbor. Go to the BGP Announcements tab and make sure that the router broadcasts announcements for all networks to which its interfaces are directed:\n\n172.17.0.0/24;\n172.20.2.0/24.\n\nBoth announcements must have green markers.\n\n5. Configure BGP neighbors for the client network router\n\nConnect to a router on your local network.\nSpecify parameters for connecting via the BGP protocol:\n\n   The client network ASN: 65512;\n   Router ID: 172.20.2.204;\n   The virtual network ASN: 64512;\n   BGP router ID: 172.20.2.215;\n   Use BFD.\n(Optional) Check that BFD connection is established.\nCheck that a connection with the BGP neighbor is established. If the BGP connection is established, the response must have keepalivetime and uptime values more than zero.\nView all available BGP routes. The list of routes should include the networks 172.17.0.0/24 and 172.20.2.0/24.\n\n\n Example setup for MikroTik\n\nConnect to MikroTik via SSH and run the command::\n\n        /routing bgp connection\n    add addressfamiliesip as65512 local.address172.20.2.204 .roleebgp namebgpcustomer output.networkbgp_networks remote.address172.20.2.215 .as64512 routerid172.20.2.204 usebfdyes\n    Check the connection is established using the BFD protocol.

Configure static routes between networks\n\nConfigure a static route from the virtual network vkcloudnet to the client network customernet via an advanced router:\n\n   In your management console, go to Virtual networks → Networks..\n   Select the vkcloudnet network and open its subnets's settings.\n   Select Show static route field.\n   Enter the route: 10.0.0.0/24  172.17.0.100.\n   Click Save.\n\nConfigure a static route from the client network customernet to the virtual network vkcloudnet via the BGP router of the client network. The route must be to 172.17.0.0/24 via 10.0.0.15.\n\nReboot the 172.17.0.8 and 10.0.0.5 machines so that the routes are included in their route network.\n\nCheck that static routes are registered on the VM 172.17.0.8, which is located in the virtual network vkcloudnet. Connect to the vkcloudvm VM via SSH and run the command:\n\n       ip route\n\n   The list of routes should include the networks 10.0.0.0/24 and 172.20.2.0/24.\nCheck the list of routes for machine 10.0.0.5, which is located on the client network customernet. The list of routes should include the networks 172.17.0.0/24 and 172.20.2.0/24.\n\n7. Check the direct connection\n\nPing or traceout a machine on the opposite network. If a response comes from another network, then the network connection has been configured correctly.\n\nFor instance, ping the 10.0.0.5 machine on the client network from the 172.17.0.8 machine on the virtual network:\n\nConnect to the vkcloudvm VM via SSH.\nPing the internal IP address of a machine on the client network:\n\n            ping 10.0.0.5\n\nThe IP address must respond to ping.\n\nThe structured interaction between the networks and the VMs within networks looks like this:\n\nThe interaction between networks schemeparamsnoBordertrue\n\nDelete unused resources\n\nIf you no longer need the created resources, delete them:\n\nDelete the virtual machine.\nDelete routers.\nDelete the subnet and the network.\n","url":"/en/networks/directconnect/how-to-guides/advanced-router","categoryPartialPath":"/en/networks","description":"How to organize data transfer between the on premise infrastructure and the VK Cloud platform using a direct connection and an advanced router.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Networks and content delivery","link":"/en/networks","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Direct Connect","link":"/en/networks/directconnect","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"421ea5fc-afe0-4cdb-b1ab-535c1c648e77","title":"Quick start","data":"Быстрый старт поможет вам начать работу с сервисом и познакомиться с его возможностями.\n\nПройдя все шаги быстрого старта, вы научитесь загружать объекты в бакет и предоставлять доступ к загруженным объектам по ссылке.\n\n\n\nЗагруженные в бакет объекты тарифицируются.

By default, the AWS CLI is installed to C: \\\\ Program Files \\\\ Amazon \\\\ AWSCLIV2.\n\nYou can use the Windows Standard Command Line Interface (cmd) to confirm the installation:\n\n aws version\n\nAccessing the CLI\n\nAccess keys consist of an access key identifier and a secret access key, which are used to sign software requests sent to VK Cloud. If access keys are missing, they can be created in the VK Cloud Control Panel.\n\nThe only time the private access key can be viewed or downloaded is when the keys are generated. It will be impossible to restore them later. However, you can create new access keys at any time.\n\nIn the VK Cloud panel, in the \"Accounts\" menu of the \"Object Storage\" service, you need to add an account, and save the received keys for future use.\n\nCLI setup\n\nThe fastest way to customize your AWS CLI installation is with the command:\n\n aws configure\n\nWhen you enter this command, the AWS CLI prompts for four pieces of information:\n\nAccess key identifier  the received key identifier data is used when adding an account.\nSecret access key  the received secret key data is used when adding an account.\nAWS region  the region where the Cloud Storage service is located, by default it is rumsk.\nOutput Format  Determines how to format the output of the command being used. If no output format is specified, it will use json by default. Available options:\n\n  json – The output is formatted as a JSON string.\n  yaml – The output is formatted as a YAML string.\n  yamlstream – The output is streamed and formatted as a YAML string. Streaming allows for faster handling of large data types.\n  text – The output is formatted as multiple lines of tabseparated string values. This can be useful to pass the output to a text processor, like grep, sed, or awk.\n  table – The output is formatted as a table using the characters + to form the cell borders. It typically presents the information in a \"humanfriendly\" format that is much easier to read than the others, but not as programmatically useful.\n\nThe AWS CLI stores this information in a profile (set of settings) called default in the credentials file. By default, the information in this profile is used when you run an AWS CLI command that does not explicitly specify the profile to use.\n\nFeatures:\n\nWhen using the AWS CLI to work with Object Storage, there are a few things to keep in mind:\n\nThe AWS CLI treats Cloud Storage as a hierarchical file system and object keys are in the form of a file path.\nWhen running the aws command to work with Cloud Storage, the endpointurl parameter is required because the client is configured by default to work with Amazon servers.\nBucket creation should be done using the appropriate endpointurl  http://hb.bizmrg.com.\nAny operations cannot be performed using the CLI with the Backup bucket class.\nWhen using the storage classes storageclass, the STANDARD values for Hotbox and STANDARD_IA for Icebox apply.\nWhen working in MacOS, in some cases it is required to run the following view:\n\n export PYTHONPATH /Library/Python/2.7/sitepackages; aws s3  endpointurlhttp://hb.bizmrg.com\n\nExamples of using\n\nCreate a bucket:\n\n aws s3 mb s3: // endpointurl http://hb.bizmrg.com\n\nChanging the bucket storage class:\n\n aws s3api createbucket bucket  endpointurl  cliinputjson \"\\\" Bucket \\ \": \\\" storageclass \\ \": \\\"  \\ \"\"\n\nFile upload\n\n aws s3 cp  s3: //  endpointurl http://hb.bizmrg.com\n\nDownloading an object\n\n aws s3 cp s3: //  /   endpointurl http://hb.bizmrg.com\n\nSynchronizing a local directory with a bucket\n\n aws s3 sync  s3: //  endpointurl http://hb.bizmrg.com\n\nMoving an object\n\n aws s3 mv s3: //  /  s3: //  /  endpointurl http://hb.bizmrg.com\n\nGetting a list of objects\n\n aws s3 ls s3: //  endpointurl http://hb.bizmrg.com\n\nDeleting an Object\n\n aws s3 rm s3: //  /  endpointurl http://hb.bizmrg.com\n\nRemoving a multicomponent object\n\n aws s3api abortmultipartupload bucket  endpointurl http://hb.bizmrg.com key large_test_file uploadid\n","url":"/en/storage/s3/connect/s3-cli","categoryPartialPath":"/en/storage","description":"","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Storage","link":"/en/storage","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Storage","link":"/en/storage/s3","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"f598e9bb-7761-4b67-be7a-d02ef39081fe","title":"File managers","data":"Graphical tools such as file managers allow you to view objects in a bucket by simulating a hierarchical directory structure.\n\nBefore starting work\n\nBefore you start working with file managers, you need to create an authorized account or make sure it exists, as well as the availability of data on the key ID and secret key.\n\nYou can create an account in the \"Accounts\" menu of the \"Object Storage\" service using the \"Add account\" button.\n\nWhen you create an account, you will be provided with data that you want to save.

Usually, event notifications are delivered in seconds, but sometimes it can take a minute or more.\n\nList of notifications\n\nCurrently Cloud Storage can publish notifications for the following events:\n\nNew Object Creation Events  Cloud Storage supports several APIs for object creation. You can request notification when only a specific API is used (for example, s3: ObjectCreated: Put), or you can use a wildcard (for example, s3: ObjectCreated: \\*) to request notification when an object is created, regardless of the API used.\nObject removal events  support for object removal.

You can also use the s3: ObjectRemoved: \\* wildcard to request a notification whenever an object is deleted.\n\nTurn on notification\n\nEnabling notifications is a bucketlevel operation; that is, the notification configuration information is stored in the notification subresources associated with the bucket. You can use any of the following methods to manage notification configuration:\n\nUsing the VK Cloud control panel\n\nThe VK Cloud dashboard interface allows you to customize the notification configuration for the bucket without writing any code.

The maximum size of a regular file that can be uploaded to a bucket is 32 GB. For files that exceed this size, you must use the multipart upload and store method. For a comfortable download of a file larger than 1 GB, it is recommended to use the AWS S3 CLI or Cloud Storage REST API.\n\nLoading from VK Cloud Panel\n\nTo load objects, go to the created bucket in the \"Buckets\" section of the \"Object Storage\" service.\n\n\n\nTo load folders through the VK Cloud Panel interface, they must be dragged into the loading window using the Drag & Drop function. You can drag and drop files to upload files or select them using the Select Files button.

It then assigns a key object name, which is a combination of the downloaded file name and the folder name. For example, if you download a folder named / images that contains two files, sample1.jpg and sample2.jpg, Cloud Storage downloads the files and then assigns the appropriate key names, images / sample1.jpg and images / sample2.jpg. Key names include the folder name as a prefix. The VK Cloud panel displays only the part of the key name that follows the last \"/\". For example, in the images folder, the images / sample1.jpg and images / sample2.jpg objects appear as sample1.jpg and sample2.jpg.\n\nIf an object with a key name that already exists in the bucket is loaded, Cloud Storage replaces the existing object.\n\nBooting from AWS CLI\n\nS3 CLI provides several options for loading objects:\n\nThe following command copies the file to the specified bucket and sets the key:\n\n aws s3 cp test.txt s3: //mybucket/test2.txt endpointurl https://hb.bizmrg.com\n\nFor the convenience of loading files from a local directory, you can apply synchronization of objects, the keys of which will be automatically generated after the completion of loading objects into the specified bucket.\n\nIf objects already exist in the bucket, then the files are subject to synchronization:\n\nThe size of which is different from the size of the object Cloud Storage\nLocal file last modified time is newer than Cloud Storage object last modified time\nLocal file does not exist in the specified bucket\n\n aws s3 sync  s3: //  endpointurl https://hb.bizmrg.com\n\nA complete description of copying and moving objects and files is available in the official S3 CLI documentation.\n","url":"/en/storage/s3/service-management/objects/upload-object","categoryPartialPath":"/en/storage","description":"","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Storage","link":"/en/storage","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Storage","link":"/en/storage/s3","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"1a089ded-2908-4cce-a8bd-5e6d0775ee4a","title":"Managing objects in a bucket","data":"Просмотр списка объектов\n\n\n\nЛичный кабинет\nAWS CLI\nGolang SDK\nPython SDK\n\n\n\nПерейдите в личный кабинет VK Cloud.\nВыберите проект, где находится нужный бакет.\nПерейдите в раздел Объектное хранилище → Бакеты.\nНажмите на имя нужного бакета.\n\n\n\n\nУстановите и настройте AWS CLI, если он еще не установлен.\n\nОткройте консоль и выполните команду:\n\n            aws s3 ls s3:// endpointurl\n\n      Здесь:\n\n      `` — домен сервиса Cloud Storage, должен соответствовать региону аккаунта:\n         https://hb.bizmrg.com — домен региона Москва;\n         https://hb.kzast.bizmrg.com — домен региона Казахстан.\n\n      Пример команды просмотра списка объектов\n\n      Пример команды:\n\n            aws s3 ls s3://mybucket endpointurl https://hb.bizmrg.com\n\n      Пример ответа:\n\n                                          PRE folder/\n      20230927 11:45:05     421326 picture1.jpg\n      20230927 11:47:37       2713 picture2.png\n      20230927 11:48:37       2662 picture3.png\n      20230927 10:31:02      48314 picture4.png\n      20230927 11:48:56        361 deletepicture.png\n\n\nПолное описание операций просмотра объектов доступно в официальной документации AWS CLI.\n\n\n\n\nУстановите и настройте SDK для Go, если он еще не установлен.\n\nДобавьте реквизиты подключения к Cloud Storage в переменные окружения или конфигурационный файл, если этого не было сделано ранее.\n\nДобавьте код в свой проект:\n\n      package main\n\n   import (\n\t   \"github.com/aws/awssdkgo/aws\"\n\t   \"github.com/aws/awssdkgo/aws/session\"\n\t   \"github.com/aws/awssdkgo/service/s3\"\n\t   \"log\"\n   )\n\n   const vkCloudHotboxEndpoint  \"https://hb.bizmrg.com\"\n\n   const defaultRegion  \"useast1\"\n\n   func main() \n\t   // Создание сессии\n\t   sess, _ : session.NewSession()\n\n\t   // Подключение к сервису Cloud Storage\n\t   svc : s3.New(sess, aws.NewConfig().WithEndpoint(vkCloudHotboxEndpoint).WithRegion(defaultRegion))\n\n\t   bucket : \"gobucket\"\n\t   // получение списка объектов в бакете\n\t   result, err : svc.ListObjectsV2(&s3.ListObjectsV2Input\n\t\t   Bucket: aws.String(bucket),\n\t   )\n\t   if err !

Modern browsers use CORS in container APIs like XMLHttpRequest or Fetch to mitigate the risks inherent in requests from other sources.\n\nUsage scenarios\n\nThe use cases for CORS technology are listed below.\n\nScenario #1**. For example, personal resources host a website in a bucket called website. Users load the site endpoint URL. It now becomes necessary to use JavaScript on web pages stored in this bucket to send authenticated GET and PUT requests to the same bucket using the bucket service API endpoint. Normally, the browser will prevent JavaScript from executing to allow such requests, but using CORS technology, you can set up a bucket so that crossorigin requests are allowed from the website.\nScenario #2**. For example, you need to place a web font from a service bucket on your resources. Browsers are required to perform CORS checks (preflight) to load web fonts, so the bucket hosting the web font must be configured to allow requests from any origin.\n\nCreate a CORS rule\n\nThe \"Object storage\" service supports the technology of crossdomain requests for resources in a bucket. You can create a rule on the CORS tab of an open bucket.\n\nWhere:\n\nAllowedOrigins  a website from which crossdomain requests to the bucket are allowed. Can contain at most one \\* character.\nAllowedMethods  HTTP method allowed to be used for crossdomain request. You can use multiple methods in one rule.\nMaxAgeSeconds — time in seconds during which the browser caches the result of a request to an object using the options method.\nAllowedHeaders — allowed header in the request to the object. A single \\* character can be used in the header name to define a pattern. Object storage matches the headers passed in AccessControlRequestHeaders to the AllowedHeaders set and responds to options with a list of allowed ones.\nExposeHeaders  header allowed to be displayed in a JavaScript application in a browser. In a request to an object, the JavaScript client can only operate on the headers defined in the ExposeHeaders elements.\n\nIf necessary, you can add multiple parameter values ​​in the rules configurator.\n","url":"/en/storage/s3/service-management/access-management/cors","categoryPartialPath":"/en/storage","description":"Scenarios using and creation of the CORS Rules","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Storage","link":"/en/storage","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Storage","link":"/en/storage/s3","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"bbc8dd2f-6a1d-4252-94f9-29b1f657b57a","title":"Access Control List","data":"general information\n\nAccess Control List VK Cloud (ACL or Access Control List) allow you to control access to buckets and objects. Each bucket and object has its own ACL, with which you can determine which accounts and groups are granted access, as well as the type of access. When receiving a request for a resource, the service checks the corresponding ACL to see if the requestor has access rights.\n\n\n\nBy default, the created bucket or object gets a Private ACL, where the owner has full rights, and the rest of the participants have access denied.\n\n\n\nWhen a container or object is created, the service creates a standard ACL that grants the resource owner full control over that resource and denies access to other projects. This is shown in the following bucket ACL example (the default object ACL has the same structure).\n\n .hb.bizmrg.com / images / 01.jpg /\">\n\n \\\\\\* OwnerCanonicalUserID \\\\\\*\n ownerdisplayname\n\n \\\\\\* OwnerCanonicalUserID \\\\\\*\n displayname\n\n FULL_CONTROL\n\nThe `` element identifies the owner by the canonical user ID of the VK Cloud account.\nThe `` element identifies the recipient (VK Cloud account or predefined group) and grants permission.\n\nThe base ACL shown as an example defaults to one Grant element per owner. To grant permission, ` elements are added, each ` element must specify the grantor and permission options.\n\n\n\nACLs can contain up to 100 permissions.\n\nRecipient of rights\n\nThe recipient of rights can be an VK Cloud project or one of the global VK Cloud groups. Rights can be granted to an VK Cloud project using the project ID address (PID) or the canonical user ID. Moreover, if you specify the project identifier in the request for access rights, then the service determines the canonical user ID for the corresponding project and adds it to the ACL. As a result, the ACL will always contain the canonical user ID for the project, not the project ID.\n\nTo grant access rights, you must specify each recipient as a type  value pair, where type is one of the following:\n\nid — the canonical user ID of the VK Cloud account\nuri is a predefined group to which permission is granted\nemailAddress — VK Cloud project ID (PID)\n\nExample: project ID\n\nFor example, the xamzgrantread header grants VK Cloud accounts identified by mcs_pid permissions to read object data and its metadata:\n\n xamzgrantread: emailAddress  \"mcs1447309426\", emailAddress  \"mcs1380112926\"\n\n\n\nWhen granting other VK Cloud accounts access to their resources, please note that VK Cloud accounts can delegate their permissions to users under their own accounts. This is known as multiaccount access.\n\nheading(Canonical user ID)iduserid\n\nThe canonical user ID is associated with the VK Cloud account. It's a long string like eab55955ebdb4f18a94df3558ff150da.\nCanonical user ID is a unique identifier consisting of a set of characters. Example  fcd689086c7642d1968b82ae2a5a251d. The format is not fixed, when you work with canonical user IDs, do not use transformations and bindings to the identifier format.\n\nIt can be calculated using the command\n\n aws s3api listbuckets query Owner.ID output text endpointurl https://hb.bizmrg.com\n\nYou can also find the canonical user ID of the VK Cloud account by reading the ACL of the bucket or object that the VK Cloud account has access to. When an individual VK Cloud account is granted permissions on a Grant request, a grant entry with the canonical user ID of the VK Cloud account is added to the ACL.\n\n\n\nIf you make your bucket public (not recommended), any unauthenticated user can upload objects to the bucket. These anonymous users do not have an VK Cloud account. When an anonymous user uploads an object to a bucket, Cloud Storage adds a special canonical user ID (65a011a29cdf8ec533ec3d1ccaae921c) as the owner of the object to the ACL.\n\nheading(Project ID)idprojectid\n\nProject ID (mcs_pid) — a unique parameter that characterizes a project on the VK Cloud platform. You can get it in your management console in the account information area.\n\nThe button located next to the project ID allows you to copy the parameter for convenience.\n\nPredefined groups\n\nCloud Storage has a set of predefined groups. When granting access to an account to a group, one of the URIs is specified instead of the canonical user ID. The following predefined groups are available:\n\nAuthenticated Users — a group of authorized users, represented by http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers.\n\nAll VK Cloud accounts are represented in this group. Permission to access this group allows any VK Cloud account to access the resource. However, all requests must be signed (authenticated).\n\n\n\nWhen granting access to the Authenticated Users group of users, any authorized VK Cloud user from the Internet can access the resource.\n\n\n\nAll Users — The All Users group, represented by http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers.\n\nPermission to access this group allows anyone on the Internet to access the resource. Requests can be signed (authenticated) or unsigned (anonymous). Unsigned requests omit the Authentication header in the request.\n\n\n\nIt is highly recommended that you do not grant permission to the All Users group with WRITE, WRITE_ACP, or FULL_CONTROL authority. For example, WRITE permissions allow anyone to store objects in a bucket, which is paid for by the current owner. It also allows others to delete objects that might need to be kept.\n\nheading(Types of permits)idpermissons\n\nThe table lists the permission sets that Cloud Storage supports in the ACL. The ACL permission set is the same for object ACL and bucket ACL. These ACLs grant permissions for specific buckets or object operations. The table lists the permissions and describes what they mean in the context of objects and buckets.\n\nResolutionApplying to a bucketApplying to an objectREADHeadBucketGetBucketLifecycleGetBucketNotificationListObjectsListPartsListMultipartsAllows you to get the content of an object and its metadata:GetObjectHeadObjectGetObjectRangeWRITEAllows you to create, delete, overwrite any objects in the bucket:DeleteBucketNotificationPutBucketNotificationPutBucketLifecycleDeleteBucketLifecycleDeleteObjectDeletMultipleObjectsAbortMultipartInitMultipartUploadPartCompliteMultipartPutObjectPutObjectCopyNot applicableREAD_ACPAllows reading the bucket ACL:GetBucketAclGetBucketCorsAllows reading the ACL of an object:GetObjectAclWRITE_ACPAllows you to change the bucket ACL:CreatePrefixKeyDeletePrefixKeyListPrefixKeysPutBucketCorsDeleteBucketCorsPutBucketAclAllows changing the ACL of an objectPutObjectAclFULL_CONTROLCombines READ, WRITE, READ_ACP, WRITE_ACP permissions for bucketCombines READ, WRITE, READ_ACP, WRITE_ACP rights for an object\n\nMapping ACL Permissions and Access Policy Permissions\n\nThe ACL only allows a finite set of permissions compared to the number of permissions that can be set in the access policy. Each of these permissions allows one or more Cloud Storage operations to be performed.\n\nThe following table shows how each ACL permission maps to the corresponding access policy permissions. As you can see, the access policy allows more permissions than the ACL. ACL is used primarily to grant basic read and write permissions, similar to file system permissions.\n\nACL permissionAccess policy for bucketObject access policyREADs3: ListBucket, s3: ListBucketMultipartUploadss3: GetObjectWRITEs3: PutObject, s3: DeleteObjectNot applicableREAD_ACPs3: GetBucketAcls3: GetObjectAclWRITE_ACPs3: PutBucketAcls3: PutObjectAclFULL_CONTROLEquivalent to providing READ, WRITE,READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP ACL permissionsEquivalent to granting READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP ACL permissions\n\nStatus keys\n\nWhen granting access policy permission, you can use conditional keys to restrict the ACL value for an object using a bucket policy. The following context keys correspond to ACLs. These context keys are intended to indicate the use of a specific ACL in a request:\n\ns3: xamzgrantread  Read access\ns3: xamzgrantwrite  Write rights\ns3: xamzgrantreadacp  Access to read ACL bucket\ns3: xamzgrantwriteacp  Bucket ACL write permissions\ns3: xamzgrantfullcontrol  Full control\ns3: xamzacl  Use a templated ACL\n\nACL example\n\n .hb.bizmrg.com / images / 01.jpg /\">\n\n OwnercanonicaluserID\n displayname\n\n OwnercanonicaluserID\n displayname\n\n FULL_CONTROL\n\n user1canonicaluserID\n displayname\n\n WRITE\n\n user2canonicaluserID\n displayname\n\n READ\n\n http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers\n READ\n\nFixed ACL\n\nCloud Storage supports a set of predefined permissions known as standard ACLs. Each fixed ACL has a predefined set of recipients and permissions. The following table lists the standard ACLs and their associated predefined permissions.\n\nFixed ACLRefers toPermissions added to ACLprivateBucket and objectThe owner gets FULL_CONTROL. Nobody else has access rights (default).publicreadBucket and objectThe owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AllUsers group gets READ access.publicreadwriteBucket and objectThe owner gets FULL_CONTROL.

If you specify this template ACL when creating a bucket, Cloud Storage will ignore it.bucketownerfullcontrolAn objectBoth the object owner and the bucket owner get FULL_CONTROL over the object. If you specify this fixed ACL when creating a bucket, will ignore it.\n\n\n\nOnly one of these fixed ACLs can be specified in a request.\n\n\n\nThe request specifies a fixed ACL using the xamzacl request header. When receives a request with a standard ACL in the request, it adds the predefined permissions to the ACL of the resource.\n","url":"/en/storage/s3/service-management/access-management/s3-acl","categoryPartialPath":"/en/storage","description":"","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Storage","link":"/en/storage","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Storage","link":"/en/storage/s3","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"8f2f61c3-5ffd-496f-9f55-7006c314a2b8","title":"Creating a disk from a large OS image","data":"VK Cloud has restrictions on the size of downloaded images of operating systems.

However, you can create a logical hierarchy using object key names that imply a directory structure. For example, you can name the object not sample.jpg, but photos / 2020 / August / 01.jpg.\n\nTo retrieve an object with this logical hierarchy, you must specify the fully qualified name of the object in the GET operation.\n\nInquiry:\n\n GET /example.txt HTTP / 1.1\n\nHost: mytestbucket1.hb.bizmrg.com\nxamzcontentsha256: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855\nxamzdate: 20200831T190539Z\nAuthorization: AWS4HMACSHA256 Credential  II5JDQBAN3JYM4DNEB6C / 20170710 / rumsk / s3 / aws4_request, SignedHeaders  host; xamzcontentsha256; xamzdate, Signature  e912de558677884f08b83d3bd3d558677884f07d8bd3bd3d8687884f08d4d4d1d3d1d3d2c8d8c884f04d4d4d4d1c4d4d4d4d4d4d4d4d4d4d4f4d4f4d4f4d4f4d4f8244f07104f07104f07104f07104f07104f07104f0710\n\nAnswer:\n\n HTTP / 1.1 200 OK\n\nDate: Mon, 31 Aug 2020 19:05:39 GMT\nxamzrequestid: tx00000000000000279f46e005963d0031268crumska\nContentType: text / plain\nContentLength: 14\nAcceptRanges: bytes\nLastModified: Mon, 31 Aug 2020 19:05:09 GMT\nEtag: \"b3a92f49e7ae64acbf6b3e76f2040f5e\"\nConnection: close\n\nExample text.\n\nUpload\n\nThe PUT operation adds an object to the bucket. To perform the operation, you must have WRITE rights to the bucket.\n\nCloud Storage adds partial objects if the object size exceeds 50MB. If a successful response is received, then the entire object has been added to the bucket.\n\nWhen performing concurrent PUT operations and when there are identical loadable objects, Cloud Storage overwrites everything except the last written object.\n\nTo prevent data corruption while traversing the network, it is recommended to use the ContentMD5 header, which checks the object against the provided MD5 value and returns an error if it does not match. Alternatively, you can compute MD5 by placing an object in a bucket and compare the returned ETag with the computed MD5.\n\nInquiry:\n\n PUT /example.txt HTTP / 1.1\n\nContentLength: 14\nContentType: text / plain\nHost: mytestbucket1.hb.bizmrg.com\nxamzcontentsha256: 003f0e5fe338b17be8be93fec537764ce199ac50f4e50f2685a753c4cc781747\nxamzdate: 20200831T194605Z\nxamzmetas3cmdattrs: uid: 1000 / gname: asb / uname: asb / gid: 1000 / mode: 33204 / mtime: 1499727909 / atime: 1499727909 / md5: fb08934ef619f205f272b0adfd6c099713 / c405time: 1499727909\nxamzstorageclass: STANDARD\nAuthorization: AWS4HMACSHA256 Credential  II5JDQBAN3JYM4DNEB6C / 20200831 / rumsk / s3 / aws4_request, SignedHeaders  contentlength; contenttype; host; xamzcontentsha256; xamzdate; xamz metas3cmdattrs; xamzstorageclass, Signature  a9a9e16da23e0b37ae8362824de77d66bba2edd702ee5f291f6ecbb9ebac6013\n\n\nExample text.\n\nAnswer:\n\n HTTP / 1.1 200 OK\n\nDate: Mon, 31 Aug 2020 19:46:06 GMT\nxamzrequestid: tx0000000000000027bd57c005963d97e1268crumska\nContentLength: 0\nAcceptRanges: bytes\nLastModified: Mon, 31 Aug 2020 19:05:09 GMT\nEtag: \"fb08934ef619f205f272b0adfd6c018c\"\nConnection: close\n\nCopy\n\nPUT operations can create a copy of an object that is already stored in the bucket. The copy PUT operation is identical to the sequential execution of GET and PUT. Adding the xamzcopysource request header causes the PUT operation to copy the source object to the target bucket.\n\nWhen copying an object, you can keep most of the metadata (default) or specify new metadata. To write new metadata when copying an object, you must include the xamzmetadatadirective: REPLACE header in the request. However, the ACL is not saved and is configured as private for the user making the request.\n\nAll copy requests must be authenticated and cannot contain message text. In addition, you must have READ access to the source object and WRITE access to the target bucket.\n\nA copy request can return an error in two cases. This can happen when a copy request is received, or when objects are being copied. If an error occurs before the copy operation starts, a standard error will be received. If an error occurs during a copy operation, the error will be embedded in the 200 OK response. This means that a 200 OK response can contain both success and error messages.\n\nInquiry:\n\n PUT /copiedexample.txt HTTP / 1.1\n\nHost: mytestbucket1.hb.bizmrg.com\nxamzcontentsha256: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855\nxamzcopysource: /staticimages/example.txt\nxamzdate: 20200831T202253Z\nxamzmetadatadirective: COPY\nAuthorization: AWS4HMACSHA256 Credential  II5JDQBAN3JYM4DNEB6C / 20170710 / rumsk / s3 / aws4_request, SignedHeaders  host; xamzcontentsha256; xamzcopysource; xamzdate; xamz metadatadirective; xamzstorageclass, Signature  0cb03470dd80bdd41a4b8fb06c1800b27a5059b61b0303fe589578835531c877\n\nAnswer:\n\n HTTP / 1.1 200 OK\n\nDate: Mon, 31 Aug 2020 20:22:54 GMT\nxamzrequestid: tx0000000000000027d8430005963e21d1268crumska\nContentLength: 183\nConnection: close\n\n\n 20200831T20: 22: 54.167Z\n 7967bfe102f83fb5fc7e5a02bf05e8fc\n\nHeadObject\n\nThe HEAD operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object itself.

If a new part is loaded, with the assigned part number used for one of the existing parts, the existing part will be overwritten. Each part, except the last, must be at least 5 MB in size. The last part of the multipart download has no size limit.\n\nTo ensure that the data is not tampered with as it travels over the network, you should include the ContentMD5 header in the download request for the part. VK Cloud checks the data from the parts against the provided MD5 hash value and returns an error if they do not match.\n\nInquiry:\n\n PUT /multipartfile.tar.gz?partNumber1&uploadId2~iCw_lDY8VoBhoRrIJbPMrUqnE3Z3Qh HTTP / 1.1\n\nHost: mytestbucket1.hb.bizmrg.com\nContentLength: 5242880\nxamzcontentsha256: 6ab0931e613fd0cd39af0fa4733edb6ad942df0ad33e057713d44df7195b6ecf\nxamzdate: 20200831T184459Z\nAuthorization: AWS4HMACSHA256 Credential  II5JDQBAN3JYM4DNEB6C / 20200831 / rumsk / s3 / aws4_request, SignedHeaders  host; xamzcontentsha256; xamzdate, Signature  2e4adca4d4d4404274f2e4adca4d17d440430\n\nAnswer:\n\n HTTP / 1.1 200 OK\n\nContentLength: 0\nContentType: application / xml\nDate: Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:45:01 GMT\nEtag: \"d8d3ed3a4de016917a814a2cf5acad3c\"\nxamzrequestid: tx00000000000000ab85dab005991efac66a8rumska\nConnection: close\n\nComplete Multipart Upload\n\nThe operation completes the multipart download by combining the previously loaded parts. Upon receiving this request, VK Cloud merges all loaded parts in ascending order by part number, creating a new object. In a request to complete a multipart download, you must provide a list of parts. For each part from the list, you must provide the part number and the ETag header value returned after that part is loaded.\n\nIt can take several minutes to process a request to complete a multipart upload. After starting to process the request, VK Cloud sends an HTTP response header containing a 200 OK response. Whitespace is periodically sent during request processing to prevent timeouts. Since an error can occur in a request after the initial 200 OK response has been sent, the body of the response should be checked to determine if the request was successful.\n\nInquiry:\n\n POST /multipartfile.tar.gz?uploadId2~iCw_lDY8VoBhoRrIJbPMrUqnE3Z3Qh HTTP / 1.1\n\nHost: mytestbucket1.hb.bizmrg.com\nContentLength: 5242880\nxamzcontentsha256: 6ab0931e613fd0cd39af0fa4733edb6ad942df0ad33e057713d44df7195b6ecf\nxamzdate: 20200831T184459Z\nAuthorization: AWS4HMACSHA256 Credential  II5JDQBAN3JYM4DNEB6C / 20200831 / rumsk / s3 / aws4_request, SignedHeaders  host; xamzcontentsha256; xamzdate, Signature  2e4adca4d4d4404274f2e4adca4d17d440430\n\n\n\n 1\n \"d8d3ed3a4de016917a814a2cf5acad3c\"\n\n 2\n \"adf5feafc0fe4632008d5cb30beb1c49\"\n\n 3\n \"363f6bb50866541d78e5f6f626592263\"\n\nAnswer:\n\n HTTP / 1.1 200 OK\n\nContentLength: 311\nContentType: application / xml\nDate: Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:45:01 GMT\nxamzrequestid: tx00000000000000ab962c8005991f6fe66a8rumska\nConnection: close\n\n\n\n mytestbucket1.hb.bizmrg.com\n mytestbucket1\n multipartfile.tar.gz\n f935869350d7cbfcdd219df3f377531b3\n\nAbort Multipart Upload\n\nThe operation aborts the multipart download. After aborting a multipart download, it is not possible to download additional parts using the download ID of the interrupted multipart download. The space allocated for storing the previously loaded parts will be freed. Moreover, if any parts are loaded, then such an operation may be completed or interrupted. As a result, it may be necessary to repeatedly interrupt the multipart download in order to completely free up the space occupied by all parts.\n\nInquiry:\n\n DELETE /multipartfile.tar.gz?uploadId2~iCw_lDY8VoBhoRrIJbPMrUqnE3Z3Qh HTTP / 1.1\n\nHost: mytestbucket1.hb.bizmrg.com\nContentLength: 5242880\nxamzcontentsha256: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855\nxamzdate: 20200831T202611Z\nAuthorization: AWS4HMACSHA256 Credential  II5JDQBAN3JYM4DNEB6C / 20200831 / rumsk / s3 / aws4_request, SignedHeaders  host; xamzcontentsha256; xamzdate, Signature  9e13513baz0e3473\n\nAnswer:\n\n HTTP / 1.1 200 OK\n\nDate: Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:45:01 GMT\nxamzrequestid: tx00000000000000abbaefe005992076466a8rumska\nConnection: close\n\nList Parts\n\nThe operation returns a list of parts loaded for a specific multipart load. The operation must include the download ID, which was received after the request was sent to initialize the multipart download. Such a query will return no more than 1000 loaded parts. You can limit the number of parts returned by specifying the maxparts query parameter. If the multipart load contains more than 1000 parts, then the response returns a NextPartNumberMarker element and an IsTruncated field with the value true.

For example, you can grant access to a request from the source http://www.example.com to the my.example.bucket.com bucket using the XMLHttpRequest browser functionality.\n\nTo enable crossorigin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you need to add a CORS subresource to the bucket. A CORS subresource is an XML document that configures rules that define HTTP sources and methods that can be used in your bucket. The maximum document size is 64 KB. For example, a CORS configuration on a bucket might have the following two rules set:\n\nThe first CORSRule rule allows crossorigin PUT, POST and DELETE requests from https://www.example.com. This rule also allows all headers in a preflight OPTIONS request using the AccessControlRequestHeaders header. Therefore, in response to any OPTIONS preflight request, the service returns any requested header.\nThe second rule allows crossorigin GET requests from all sources.

The GFS backup strategy does not create weekly, monthly or annual backups separately. This process is dynamic and depends on the current GFS settings. The process of deleting backups first checks that there is the required number of weekly backups. Next, it checks the presence/absence of monthly and annual backups. After that, it makes a decision to delete outdated/redundant backups, if any.\n\nChanging the GFS settings is applied at the next successful backup. If you specify to store fewer full backups than are stored now, the outdated backups will be deleted.\n\nGFS settings store:\n\nWeekly backups — full and incremental backups for the specified number of weeks.\nMonthly backups — backups created at the beginning of the month remain. Only full backups for the specified number of calendar months remain. Incremental backups are deleted.\nAnnual backups — backups created at the beginning of the year remain. Only annual backups for the specified number of years (including the current calendar year) remain. Incremental backups are deleted.\n\nUsage Scenarios\n\nA typical scenario for using GFS is to follow the requirements of corporate policies or legislation.\n\nThe most commonly used and recommended best practices are the following settings.\n\nKeep weekly backups: 4 weeks.\nStore monthly backups: 12 months.\nStore annual backups: 5 years.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhen does the \"deletion\" happen?\n\nAfter the first successful backup.\n\nCan there be one backup at the same time Monthly and Weekly (or Annual and Monthly)?\n\nNo. In the current implementation of GFS, backups have unique tags \"weekly\", \"monthly\" or \"annual\".\n\nIf it's 2022 now, how to save the annual backup for 2021, how much is it per annum?\n\nTwo. The current year also counts.\n\nWhy is Weekly backup a mandatory field?\n\nArchitectural requirement. This is necessary for the correct labeling of backups when applying the retention policy.\n","url":"/en/storage/backups/concepts/retention-policy/gfs-backup","categoryPartialPath":"/en/storage","description":"Strategy for long-term storage of GFS backups","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Storage","link":"/en/storage","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Backup","link":"/en/storage/backups","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"7b5a792a-8914-4833-a171-b10bce981fed","title":"Creating backup plans","data":"Creating a backup plan ...\n","url":"/en/storage/backups/service-management/create-backup-plan","categoryPartialPath":"/en/storage","description":"Creating a backup plan for a VM, DB or analytical DB.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Storage","link":"/en/storage","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Backup","link":"/en/storage/backups","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"cabba409-63b3-48f9-9c68-bd3e9700fc46","title":"Managing backup plans","data":"Managing backup plans ...\n","url":"/en/storage/backups/service-management/manage-backup-plan","categoryPartialPath":"/en/storage","description":"Working with a backup plan for a VM, DB or analytical DB.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Storage","link":"/en/storage","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Backup","link":"/en/storage/backups","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"010e1540-7c0b-4ad2-94f5-776dad1d68d0","title":"Creating backups","data":"Creating a backup ...\n","url":"/en/storage/backups/service-management/create-backup-copy","categoryPartialPath":"/en/storage","description":"Methods for creating a backup copy of a VM, DB or analytical DB.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Storage","link":"/en/storage","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Backup","link":"/en/storage/backups","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"8716bac2-88ee-4edc-8cb9-4bf6eca3c4b9","title":"Managing backups","data":"Managing backups ...\n","url":"/en/storage/backups/service-management/manage-backup-copy","categoryPartialPath":"/en/storage","description":"Working with backup copies of a VM, DB or analytical DB.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Storage","link":"/en/storage","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Backup","link":"/en/storage/backups","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"6414daee-8994-4038-9178-ba926bce1796","title":"Point-in-time recovery (PITR)","data":"\n\nThe PITR function is only available for databases running PostgreSQL.\n\nCreating a schedule\n\nWhen creating a PITR schedule, DBMS logs will be copied.\n\n\n\nManagement console\n\n\n\nGo to VK Cloud management console.\nGo to Databases → Backup.\nGo to the Pointintime recovery tab.\nClick the Add.\nIn the window that opens, specify:\n\n   Schedule Name: the name for the schedule being created.\n   Start time: specify the start time of the backup in the GMT+03:00 time zone.\n   Store, number of copies: specify the number of backups stored.\n   Backup interval: select the appropriate backup interval.\n   Database: select a deployed instance with a PostgreSQL DBMS.\n\nClick the Save schedule.\n\nEditing an existing schedule\n\n\n\nManagement console\n\n\n\nGo to VK Cloud management console.\nGo to Databases → Backup.\nGo to the Pointintime recovery tab.\nClick   for the required schedule and select Edit schedule.\nMake the necessary changes and click the Save schedule.\n\nViewing schedule backups\n\n\n\nManagement console\n\n\n\nGo to VK Cloud management console.\nGo to Databases → Backup.\nGo to the Pointintime recovery tab.\nClick on the name of the required schedule.\n\nA list of backups for the selected schedule will be displayed.\n\nRestore from backup\n\n\n\nManagement console\n\n\n\nGo to VK Cloud management console.\nGo to Databases → Backup.\nGo to the Pointintime recovery tab.\nClick on the name of the required schedule.\nClick   for the required backup and select Restore from backup.\nOn “Create instance” step specify the necessary parameters and click the Next step.\n(Optional) Specify the date and time of the required backup in the field of the same name.

In some cases, you may need to restart the VM.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to view the list of VMs without a backup plan?\n\nUse the Backup filter to find such VMs.\n\n\n","url":"/en/storage/backups/faq","categoryPartialPath":"/en/storage","description":"Answers to questions about the time of creation of backups, their total number, distribution by availability zones","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Storage","link":"/en/storage","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Backup","link":"/en/storage/backups","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"0a55d18e-5867-4570-990e-827062e43dd1","title":"Quick start","data":"Quick start will help you get started with the service and become familiar with its features.

Connect to your database using PSQL and execute SQL:\n\nCREATE A gtest TABLE ( ID int4, NAME varchar(20) ); SELECT AddGeometryColumn(\", 'gtest','geom', 1,'LINESTRING',2);\n\nIf the geometry failed to add a column, then you probably haven't loaded functions and objects from PostGIS into your database. See the installation instructions.\n\nNext, you can insert the geometry into the table using the SQL command insert. The GIS object will be formatted according to the format of the wellknown text of the OpenGIS Consortium:\n\nINSERT INTO gtest (ID, NAME, GEOM) VALUES (1, 'First Geometry', GeomFromText('LINESTRING(2 3,4 5,6 5,7 8)', 1) );\n\nDetailed information about other GIS objects can be found in the object directory. Viewing your GIS data in a table:\n\nSELECT ID, name, AsText(geom) AS geom FROM gtest;\n\nThe result should look something like this:\n\n id  name            geom\n++\n 1   First geometry  line(2 3,4 5,6 5,7 8) (1 row)\n\nHow to insert a GIS object into a database?\n\nLike you build other database queries using the SQL query environment to get values, functions, and logic tests.\n\nWhen building spatial queries, you should take into account:\n\nis there a spatial index that can be used;\nwhether it is necessary to perform complex calculations on a large number of geometries.\n\nMost often you will need an \"intersection operator\" (&&), which checks whether the boundaries of objects intersect. The benefit of the && operator is that it can use a spatial index if it exists. This will speed up the execution of the request.\n\nIn addition, you can use spatial functions such as Distance(), ST_Intersects(), ST_Contains() and ST_Within() and others to narrow the search results. Most spatial queries include an index test and a spatial function test. The index test is useful because it limits the number of value checks to those that can fall into the required set. Next, spatial functions are used for the final verification of the condition.\n\nSELECT id, the_geom FROM thetable WHERE the_geom && 'POLYGON((0 0, 0 10, 10 10, 10 0, 0 0))' AND _ST_Contains(the_geom,'POLYGON((0 0, 0 10, 10 10, 10 0, 0 0))');\n","url":"/en/dbs/dbaas/how-to-guides/using-postgis","categoryPartialPath":"/en/dbs","description":"Getting started with the PostGIS extension in PostgreSQL and PostgresPro.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Databases","link":"/en/dbs","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Databases","link":"/en/dbs/dbaas","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"6cfa6eb4-dade-43d0-b0c3-45f06a770e65","title":"MongoDB replication and update on Ubuntu","data":"In this article, we will look at how to replicate and upgrade MongoDB on Ubuntu 18.04.\n\n\n\nYou can learn about the hardware configuration, as well as how to install and configure MongoDB in the article Installing and configuring MongoDB on Ubuntu.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the description below, we use the following server names and IP addresses:\n\nserver 1  mongo1.testdomain.com (10.0.0.2);\nserver 2  mongo2.testdomain.com (10.0.0.3);\nserver 3  mongo1.testdomain.com (10.0.0.4).\n\nSet up ReplicaSet MongoDB\n\nReplicaset is multiple servers that contain the same set of data, provide failover protection, and provide high data availability. Replicaset MongoDB has one primary node for writing and reading, and one or more secondary nodes that are synchronized with the primary node and provide the ability to read data to reduce load. In the event of a failure in the operation of the primary node, one of the secondary nodes is automatically assigned as the primary node. To speed up the selection of a new primary node, an arbiter node is designed that does not contain data. Also, the advantage of Replicaset is the ability to update the cluster without having to stop its operation.\n\nMake sure port 27017 is open on all three servers.\nMake sure the name of each host (mongo1.testdomain.com, mongo2.testdomain.com, mongoar.testdomain.com) is known on each server.

second node with _id1 is accepted into Repliset in the secondary state.\n\nWhen a node is added to replicaset, synchronization occurs with the primary node. Until the synchronization is completed, the second node will be in the STARTUP state. Writing data to the main node slows down the synchronization, however, this is a possible scenario (for example, when writing to the database, the database of about 350 GB was synchronized for about 14 hours).Once the synchronization is complete, on the third server (mongoar) do the same as on the second (mongo2), except for the step of adding the server to repliset:\n\nrs0:PRIMARY> rs.addArb(\"mongoar.testdomain.com:27017\")\n\n\"ok\" : 1,\n\"operationTime\" : Timestamp(1577366355, 1),\n\"$clusterTime\" : \n\"clusterTime\" : Timestamp(1577366355, 1),\n\"signature\" : \n\"hash\" : BinData(0,\"pA6zLoq8JmYCFM2HZVAhr4pvK1A\"),\n\"keyId\" : NumberLong(\"6774685910094053378\")\n\n\n\nrs0:PRIMARY>\n\nCheck the status of Repliset (nothing is omitted from the output for brevity):\n\nrs0:PRIMARY> rs.status()\n\n\"set\" : \"rs0\",\n\"date\" : ISODate(\"20191226T13:21:20.710Z\"),\n\"myState\" : 1,\n\"members\" :\n\n\"_id\" : 0,\n\"name\" : \"mongo1.testdomain.com:27017\",\n\"health\" : 1,\n\"state\" : 1,\n\"stateStr\" : \"PRIMARY\",\n\"uptime\" : 3065,\n,\n\n\"_id\" : 1,\n\"name\" : \"mongo2.testdomain.com:27017\",\n\"health\" : 1,\n\"state\" : 2,\n\"stateStr\" : \"SECONDARY\",\n\"uptime\" : 937,\n,\n\n\"_id\" : 2,\n\"name\" : \"mongoar.testdomain.com:27017\",\n\"health\" : 1,\n\"state\" : 7,\n\"stateStr\" : \"ARBITER\",\n\"uptime\" : 125,\n\n\n\nAs a result, we got a primary node, a secondary node and an arbiter node.

Состоит техника в том, что данные с одного сервера базы данных постоянно копируются (реплицируются) на один или несколько других. Появляется возможность использовать не один сервер для обработки запросов, а несколько. Таким образом, появляется возможность распределить нагрузку с одного сервера на несколько.\n\nВ сервисе VK Cloud есть возможность создать реплику на этапе создания инстанса БД — для этого активируйте опцию Создать реплику на шаге Создание инстанса.\n\nОписание\n\nВ СУБД Clickhouse репликация данных настраивается на уровне таблиц, в отличие от традиционных, где это обычно уровень БД или даже инстанса. То есть для того, чтобы данные реплицировались на другие хосты в кластере, необходимо правильным образом создать таблицу. Архитектура Clickhouse подразумевает, что таблицы с одинаковым именем реплицируются между двумя репликами (то есть имеют одинаковые данные), а между шардами никак не связаны, то есть данные “шардируются”. При этом, к сожалению, это никак не контролируется Clickhouse, поэтому вам надо самостоятельно  все создать/настроить правильно.\n\nСоздание реплицируемых таблиц\n\nИтак, у нас в наличии кластер Clickhouse, например с 2 шардами  в каждом 2 реплики. Имя кластера Clickhouse в VK Cloud всегда cluster. Выполним запрос:\n\nCREATE TABLE table\\_name ON CLUSTER cluster\n(\n    EventDate DateTime,\n    CounterID UInt32,\n    UserID UInt32\n) ENGINE  ReplicatedMergeTree('/clickhouse/tables/shard/table\\_name', 'replica')\nPARTITION BY toYYYYMM(EventDate)\nORDER BY (CounterID, EventDate, intHash32(UserID))\nSAMPLE BY intHash32(UserID);\n\nЕго можно выполнить один раз на одном сервере, так как есть опция ON CLUSTER. В этом случае, Clickhouse обращается к конфигурационному файлу, где указаны все ноды кластера и выполняет запрос на каждом из них. Без этой опции можно просто выполнить такой запрос на каждой ноде.\n\nДавайте разберем особенности этой команды. Здесь используется движок таблицы ReplicatedMergeTree. Этот движок и другие из семейства Replicated рассчитаны на то, чтобы публиковать изменения в таблице в ZooKeeper. Соответственно, аргументами и являются параметры для сохранения этой информации в Zookeeper. Первая часть  это путь, вторая название ключа, в который публикуется информация. В фигурных скобках указаны макросы, макросы определяются в конфиге у каждого сервера. В кластере VK Cloud они уже будут сконфигурированы соответственно составу кластера, так что можно указывать прямо так, как в примере.\n\nВ итоге серверы реплики одного шарда будут иметь одинаковый путь в ZK, и будут применять изменения с других серверов и публиковать свои (двусторонняя репликация). Получается что можно обратиться к одному из серверов и получить актуальные данные, но как получить данные по всем шардам? Для удобства в этом случае можно использовать тип таблицы Distributed.\n\nСоздание Distributedтаблиц\n\nCREATE TABLE distributed ON CLUSTER cluster\n(\n    EventDate DateTime,\n    CounterID UInt32,\n    UserID UInt32\n) ENGINE  Distributed(cluster, default, table\\_name, UserID);\n\nТакая таблица будет указывать на таблицу на всех серверах в кластере. То есть при селектах данные будут собираться со всех нод. Создав такую таблицу на всех серверах, можно обращаться за всеми данными к каждому из них, получается своего рода балансировка нагрузки (однако, не стоит на это сильно рассчитывать, так как Clickhouse не предназначен для одновременного выполнения большого количества тяжелых запросов).\n\nЕсть два способа записывать данные на кластер:\n\nВопервых, вы можете самостоятельно определять, на какие серверы какие данные записывать, и выполнять запись непосредственно на каждый шард. То есть делать INSERT в те таблицы, на которые «смотрит» распределенная таблица. Это наиболее гибкое решение, поскольку вы можете использовать любую схему шардирования, которая может быть нетривиальной изза требований предметной области.\n\nТакже это является наиболее оптимальным решением, так как данные могут записываться на разные шарды полностью независимо.\n\nВовторых, вы можете делать INSERT в Distributed таблицу. В этом случае, таблица будет сама распределять вставляемые данные по серверам. Для того, чтобы писать в Distributed таблицу, у нее должен быть задан ключ шардирования (последний параметр). Также, если шард всеголишь один, то запись работает и без указания ключа шардирования (так как в этом случае он не имеет смысла).\n","url":"/en/dbs/dbaas/how-to-guides/clickhouse-replication","categoryPartialPath":"/en/dbs","description":"Configuring data replication for Clickhouse at the table level.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Databases","link":"/en/dbs","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Databases","link":"/en/dbs/dbaas","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"5df5a2ca-427b-48cc-8409-ce5c61490496","title":"Monitoring PostgreSQL","data":"You can monitor the status of individual PostgreSQL hosts using the monitoring tool built into the VK Cloud panel.\n\nHow to use monitoring\n\nTo view monitoring data:\n\nOpen the VK Cloud panel.\nGo to Databases→Database Instances.\nFind the required instance in the list.\nClick on the instance host for which you want to view monitoring data.\nGo to the \"Monitoring\" card.\n\nSeveral counters and graphs will be displayed:\n\nCounters reflect the current value of the metrics.\nGraphs reflect the dynamics of changes in metric values ​​within a certain time period.\n\n  On the ruler at the top, you can select the time period of interest for which you want to display data on the charts.\n  The default period is 12 hours.\n\nAvailable monitoring metrics\n\nCounters\n\nCPU metrics:\n\n  Current IOWait\n\n    Percentage of total host processor resources spent waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n\n  Current CPU\n\n    Percentage of time the host processor is running in user mode.

For more information about configuration types, see DB instance configurations.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I change the DB instance configuration file myself?\n\nNo, the configuration file is not editable by the user. To change the configuration, contact technical support. But you can change individual parameters for some DBMS according to instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the cost of the service depend on?\n\nThe cost of the service depends on the selected configuration. Payment is calculated only for the resources used, for more information, see the article Tariffication.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I add a database user?\n\nUse the instructions User management.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs backup enabled by default?\n\nBackup is not enabled by default. You can enable it when creating an instance or configure it in the Backup section.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs backup enabled for my DB?\n\nTo check if backup is enabled:\n\nGo to VK Cloud management console.\nSelect the project where the required DB instance is located.\nGo to Databases → Backup.\nGo to the Automatic or Pointintime recovery tab.\n\n   If there is a green indicator next to the name of the required plan, the backup works according to plan. If the indicator is red, the backup is suspended.\n\nBackup can be enabled when creating a DB instance or configured separately by creating a backup plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to restore a database of a different version from a backup?\n\nNo, you can restore the database only to the version for which the backup was created.\n\nTo restore a database from a backup, use the instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is the database disk autoscaling?\n\nIf autoscaling is enabled, when the free space threshold is reached, the disk expands by 10 GB.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does database scaling work?\n\nYou can change the type of VM hosting the databases or increase the disk size. When changing the VM type, the changes take effect after the VM is restarted.\n\nYou can also enable autoscaling of the database disk size. Then, as the amount of data increases, the disk size will increase automatically.\n\nFor instructions on scaling a DB instance, see DB instance management.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are the master, synchronous and asynchronous replicas distributed across the data center?\n\nThe master and replicas are located in the same data center, but upon request, technical support engineers can distribute them to different data centers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs replication asynchronous or synchronous in the MasterReplica database configuration?\n\nAsynchronous replication works for MasterReplica configurations. Synchronous and asynchronous replication is used for the cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I create a database replica?\n\nUse the instructions in the article Replication.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I install monitoring extensions for the database?\n\nInstalling extensions is described in detail in the section Managing extensions.\n\nThe monitoring service is enabled by default for PostgreSQL, PostgresPro Standard, PostgresPro Enterprise, PostgresPro Enterprise 1C.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is autoswitching between database nodes configured?\n\nWhen using a database cluster, if the wizard is unavailable, switching to other nodes will be configured automatically. When using configuration MasterReplica switching will need to be done manually:\n\nMySQL;\nPostgreSQL, Postgres Pro.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the maximum amount of data that can be stored in a DBMS?\n\nThe volume is limited by the capabilities of the disk — 2 TB for HighIOPS SSD, 5 TB for SSD (for one shard), or RAM (Redis, Tarantool).\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to create a user with readonly rights to the database through a management console?\n\nNo, this is only possible through a direct SQL query.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is user access to PostgreSQL organized?\n\nUsers access to databases is organized according to the role model of PostgreSQL itself. The user who has maximum access to one database will have access to other databases according to the public scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to use tags in Terraform?\n\nVK Cloud does not support tags in Terraform.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to move the database to another project?\n\nTransferring PaaS service objects between projects is not supported. The virtual machine on which the database was deployed can only be transferred to another project as a regular virtual machine. It is not possible to migrate such a virtual machine as a database instance or create a database instance with a disk transferred from another project.\n\n\n","url":"/en/dbs/dbaas/faq","categoryPartialPath":"/en/dbs","description":"Answers to frequently asked questions about the Cloud Databases service.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Databases","link":"/en/dbs","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Databases","link":"/en/dbs/dbaas","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"f74c1da7-47d8-4301-b952-9e8ad387a781","title":"Create","data":"To create a database, go to the section of your management console \"Analytical databases\", select the license version \"Arenadata DB\" and click \"Create database\".\n\nIn the next step, select the required cluster type, ArenadataDB instance version, and instance configuration.\n\nThe Cluster configuration is a cluster with synchronous data replication.

This is an http server that Greenplum talks to all its nodes at once, achieving high speeds for both downloading and uploading data.\n\nOfficial gpfdist documentation available at the official resource.\n\nWhat is gpfdist used for? Greenplum has the concept of external table (external tables), the description of which looks almost the same as for ordinary tables, but at the end a condition like LOCATION ('gpfdist://hostname:8080/database_name/table_name.csv') is added, which indicates exactly where the file is stored, the structure of which is described in the external table. External table can be either readable or writable.\n\nIf the external table is created for reading, then, firstly, instead of the file name, you can use a mask (that is, you can read or download many files at once), and secondly, you can read from archived files (.gz, .zip or . bz2), which significantly increases the speed of reading and loading files, since reading data from disks is reduced many times compared to reading unarchived files.\n\nExternal table can work with multiple instances of gpfdist running at once, even on different nodes. This further increases the performance of the system  both for loading and unloading data.\n","url":"/en/dbs/adb/quick-start/launch-adb","categoryPartialPath":"/en/dbs","description":"","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Databases","link":"/en/dbs","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Arenadata DB as a Service","link":"/en/dbs/adb","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"d79c3b19-e66a-44be-8fd8-f2f5955d1420","title":"About the service","data":"Description\n\nArenadata DB (ADB) is a distributed DBMS that uses the MPP (massively parallel processing) concept and is based on an open source DBMS  Greenplum.\n\nAnalytical massively parallel DBMS are designed for storing and processing large amounts of data  from units to hundreds of terabytes of data. Such DBMSs are most often used for predictive analytics, regular reporting, customer churn analysis, and building corporate data warehouses.\n\nArenadata DB is a fast clustering solution with which you can deploy distributed databases. It allows you to store and process large amounts of structured and semistructured data and build models based on them, for example, for BI analytics. In contrast to the use of similar analytical databases On Premises, Arenadata DB as a service allows you to speed up the construction of complex analytical queries up to 5 times by being able to quickly scale to hundreds of nodes in the VK Cloud cloud infrastructure.\n\nThe ADB architecture is a classic cluster: several shard servers, one master server and one standby server, interconnected by fast networks. Each server shard contains several PostgreSQL shards (instances) containing data. If one or more segments fail, they are marked as bad and their mirrored segments are started instead, the data for which is replicated using the Wright Ahead Log (WAL) technology used in PostgreSQL  all table and index changes are written to the file only after logging them).\n\nKey benefits of Arenadata DB\n\nAll support and expertise for implementation is available in Russia and in Russian.\nA package of utilities for offline installation (without Internet access) has been developed.\nThe distribution is based on the Opensource Greenplum DBMS kernel.\nCompletely Russian software.\nSupport is available both remotely and onsite. There is a set of available package services for planning, installing, auditing the system.\nThere is a possibility of further development and customization of the product for the specific needs of the customer.\nImplementation is available both on \"bare metal\" and in the cloud.\n","url":"/en/dbs/adb/concepts/about","categoryPartialPath":"/en/dbs","description":"","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Databases","link":"/en/dbs","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Arenadata DB as a Service","link":"/en/dbs/adb","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"9c723882-5ac4-46cb-b6b9-fd36d99ff493","title":"Connections from internal networks","data":"Connecting to an instance\n\nTo connect to an ADB instance, use the database instance connection instructions.\n\nAdditional information can be found in the documentation for the connector used (a connector is an entity that connects to a database).\n","url":"/en/dbs/adb/connect/int-connect-adb","categoryPartialPath":"/en/dbs","description":"","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Databases","link":"/en/dbs","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Arenadata DB as a Service","link":"/en/dbs/adb","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"f195b39d-32b6-4198-af62-3150e5afacfa","title":"External connections","data":"Connecting to an instance\n\n\n\nAttention\n\nConnecting externally requires an ADB instance with external IP enabled.

Preparatory steps\n\n1.1. Create a cluster\n\nGo to management console VK Cloud.\nSelect project, where the cluster will be placed.\nGo to Containers → Kubernetes clusters.\nIf there are no clusters in the selected project yet, click Create cluster.\n\n   Otherwise, click Add.\n\nIn the “Configuration” step:\n\n   Select the cluster configuration Dev environment with the newest version of Kubernetes.\n\n\n      Note the version of Kubernetes selected. This is important for further installation of kubectl.\n\n\n   Click the Next Step button.\n\nIn the “Create cluster” step, set:\n\n   Cluster name: for example, vkcloudk8squickstart.\n   Virtual machine type — Master: STD328.\n   Availability zone: Moscow (MS1).\n\n\n      Configuration files for creating and configuring resources in the cluster are designed to use this zone.\n\n      If you choose another zone, adjust configuration files.\n\n\n   Network: Create new network.\n   Assign external IP: make sure this option is selected.\n   Leave the other settings unchanged.\n   Press the Next step button.\n\nIn the “Node group” step, set:\n\n   Node type: STD348.\n   Availability zone: Moscow (MS1).\n\n\n      Configuration files for creating and configuring resources in the cluster are designed to use this zone.\n\n      If you choose another zone, adjust configuration files.\n\n\n   Leave the other settings unchanged.\n   Click the Create cluster button.\n\nWait for the cluster to complete, this process may take a while.\n\n1.2. Install addons in the cluster\n\n\n\nWhen installing the Docker Registry and Ingress NGINX addons, standard load balancers will be created for them.\n\nUsage of this load balancer is charged.\n\n\n\nInstall the dockerregistry addon.\n\n   Write down the data for accessing the Docker registry.\n\nInstall the kubeprometheusstack addon.\n\n   Write down the password to access the Grafana web interface.\n\nInstall the ingressnginx addon with default parameters.\n\n   Write down the floating IP address for the load balancer.\n\nFurther, the following values will be used in the commands and configuration files for the example. Replace them with the ones that are relevant to you.\n\n Parameter                                                    Value                      \n    \n IP address of the load balancerfor the Ingress controller  192.0.2.2              \n URL of the Docker registry endpoint                          192.0.2.22:5000          \n Login of the Docker registry user                            registry                 \n Password of the Docker registry user                         registrypassword123456 \n The password of the user admin for Grafana                 grafanapassword123456  \n\n1.3. Configure the environment to work with the cluster from\n\nSet up the host from which you will work with the cluster.\nThis can be a real computer or a virtual machine.\n\nInstall the following tools on the host:\n\nBrowser.\nThe kubectl utility.\n\n\n  Download a version of kubectl that matches the version of the cluster, or differs by one minor version in any direction.\n\n  For example, for cluster version 1.23.6, kubectl versions 1.22, 1.23 and 1.24 are suitable.\n\n  See Connecting to a cluster with kubectl for details.\n\n\nThe kauthproxy utility (https://github.com/int128/kauthproxy/releases). See Connecting to the cluster with Kubernetes Dashboard for details.\nThe clientkeystoneauth utility. See Connecting to the cluster with kubectl for details.\nThe curl utility.\nDocker Engine:\n  For Windows and macOS: Docker Desktop.\n  For Linux, Docker Desktop is also recommended, but you can install and use Docker from the command line.\n\n1.4. Connect to the cluster\n\nAdd the Administrator Kubernetes role in management console for the user on whose behalf the connection to the cluster will be performed:\n\n   Go to VK Cloud management console.\n   Select the project where the previously created cluster is located.\n   Go to Manage access.\n   Click   for the required user and select Edit.\n   Select the Kubernetes Administrator role from the dropdown list.\n   Save your changes.\n\nActivate API access for this user.\n\nGet kubeconfig for the cluster in VK Cloud management console:\n\n   Go to Containers → Kubernetes Clusters.\n   Find the required cluster in the list, then select Get Kubeconfig to access the cluster in its menu.\n\nMove kubeconfig to the ~/.kube directory, so you don't have to specify additional arguments when using kubectl.\n\n   The commands below assume that kubeconfig has been downloaded into the ~/Downloads directory under the name mycluster_kubeconfig.yaml.\n\n   Linux/macOS\n   Windows\n\n\n      mkdir ~/.kube && \\\n   mv /Downloads/mycluster_kubeconfig.yaml /.kube/config\n\n\n      mkdir ~/.kube; `\n   mv /Downloads/mycluster_kubeconfig.yaml /.kube/config\n\n\nCheck that kubectl can connect to the cluster:\n\n   Run the command:\n\n            kubectl clusterinfo\n\n   Enter the user password from your VK Cloud account.\n\n   If the cluster works properly and kubectl is configured to work with it, similar information will be displayed:\n\n      Kubernetes control plane is running at...\n   CoreDNS is running at...\n\n   To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl clusterinfo dump'.\n\n2. Get access to cluster monitoring tools\n\nAn addon with monitoring tools was installed in the cluster based on Prometheus and Grafana have been enabled. Also Kubernetes Dashboard is available for all Cloud Containers clusters, which allows you to not only manage the cluster, but also monitor it.\n\n\n\nPrometheus + Grafana\nKubernetes Dashboard\n\n\n\nIn a separate terminal session, run the command:\n\n      kubectl n prometheusmonitoring portforward service/kubeprometheusstackgrafana 8001:80\n\n\n   Do not close this session, or you will lose access to the Grafana web interface.\n   If port 8001 is already in use by another application, adjust the command by specifying a free port.\n\n\nOpen the Grafana web interface:\n\n   In your browser, go to the URL http://127.0.0.1:8001/.\n   Authorize with the login/password pair admin/grafanapassword123456.\n   If a password change is requested, change it.\n\nSelect Dashboards → Browse from the side menu of any preconfigured dashboard to get information about the cluster resources.\n\n\n\n\nIn a separate terminal session, run the command:\n\n      kauthproxy n kubernetesdashboard https://kubernetesdashboard.svc\n\n\n   Do not close this session, or you will lose access to the Kubernetes Dashboard web interface.\n\n\nEnter the user password from your VK Cloud account, if a password is requested.\n\nThe browser will be opened and you will be redirected to the Kubernetes Dashboard web interface. Next, select any available category to view information about the cluster resources.\n\n3. Upload the necessary images to the Docker registry\n\nThe Docker Registry addon was installed in the cluster which will store the Docker images.\n\n\n\nTo best demonstrate the capabilities of the cluster, a special Docker image with the NGINX web server will be built next.\nThe image is based on the plaintext demo image from NGINX.\n\n\n\nTo put your own images in the Docker cluster registry:\n\nAdd the Docker registry to the list of trusted registries:\n\n   Add the following parameter to the Docker daemon.json configuration file with the URL of the Docker registry endpoint:\n\n            \n        ...\n\n        \"insecureregistries\": \n          \"192.0.2.22:5000\"\n        ,\n\n        ...\n      \n\n      The location of this file for different Docker Engine installations is given in official Docker documentation.\n\n   Restart the Docker Engine.\n\n      Linux\n      Windows\n      macOS\n\n\n      Do one of the following:\n\n      Run one of the commands to perform restart:\n\n                sudo systemd restart docker\n\n                sudo service docker restart\n\n      Restart the Docker Engine from the Docker Desktop GUI (if installed).\n\n\n      Restart the Docker Engine from the Docker Desktop GUI.\n\n\n      Restart the Docker Engine from the Docker Desktop GUI.\n\n\nBuild a Docker image:\n\n   Create a directory for the files and navigate to it:\n\n      Linux/macOS\n      Windows\n\n\n            mkdir /imagebuild && cd /imagebuild\n\n\n            mkdir /imagebuild; cd /imagebuild\n\n\n   Place the following files in this directory:\n\n      Dockerfile\n\n            FROM nginx:mainlinealpine\n\n      RUN chmod R a+w /var/cache/nginx/ \\\n              && touch /var/run/nginx.pid \\\n              && chmod a+w /var/run/nginx.pid \\\n              && rm /etc/nginx/conf.d/*\n\n      COPY nginxconfig.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/\n      USER nginx\n\n      nginxconfig.conf\n\n            server \n          listen 8080;\n\n          location / \n\n              set $k8s_pv \"not present\";\n\n              if (d /etc/nginx/k8s_demo_pv/) \n                set $k8s_pv \"present\";\n              \n\n              default_type text/plain;\n              expires 1;\n              return 200 'Server address: $server_addr:$server_port\\nServer name: $hostname\\nDate: $time_local\\nURI: $request_uri\\nRequest ID: $request_id\\nRemote address (NGINX Ingress Controller): $remote_addr\\nXForwardedFor (Request source): $http_x_forwarded_for\\n\\nK8S Persistent Volume status: $k8s_pv\\n';\n          \n      \n\n\n   Run the build process:\n\n            docker build . t 192.0.2.22:5000/nginxk8sdemo:latest\n\n   Wait until the image build is complete.\n\nPlace the built image in the Docker registry:\n\n   Sign in to the registry:\n\n            docker login 192.0.2.22:5000 username registry password registrypassword123456\n\n   Push the image to the registry:\n\n            docker push 192.0.2.22:5000/nginxk8sdemo:latest\n\n   Check that the image is in the registry:\n\n            curl k X GET u registry:registrypassword123456 https://192.0.2.22:5000/v2/_catalog\n\n      Output should give you the similar information:\n\n            \"repositories\":\"nginxk8sdemo\"\n\n   Create a Kubernetes secret so you can access the uploaded image from Kubernetes:\n\n            kubectl create secret dockerregistry k8sregistrycreds dockerserver192.0.2.22:5000 dockerusernameregistry dockerpasswordregistrypassword123456\n\n4.

Configure Ingress for demo applications\n\nThe Ingress Controller addon was installed in the cluster NGINX was enabled to route incoming user requests to the applications deployed in the cluster.\n\nFor Ingress controller to route requests to the corresponding Service resources, through which the tea and coffee demo applications were published, do the following:\n\nPlace the following file in the ~/k8sdeployments directory:\n\n   deployingress.yaml\n\n      apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\n   kind: Ingress\n   metadata:\n     name: cafeingress\n   spec:\n     ingressClassName: nginx\n     rules:\n       host: cafe.example.com\n         http:\n           paths:\n             path: /tea\n               pathType: Prefix\n               backend:\n                 service:\n                   name: teasvc\n                   port:\n                     number: 80\n             path: /coffee\n               pathType: Prefix\n               backend:\n                 service:\n                   name: coffeesvc\n                   port:\n                     number: 80\n\n\nDeploy the Ingress resource:\n\n      kubectl apply f deployingress.yaml\n\nCheck if the deployment is correct by running the following kubectl command:\n\n      kubectl get ingress\n\n   You will see information that there is a working Ingress resource.\n\n6. Check that all the created resources in the cluster are working\n\nTo verify that the example is working, run curl requests to the IP address 192.0.2.2 of the load balancer. The Ingress controller associated with the load balancer will then deliver these requests to the appropriate applications.\n\nRequests for:\n\n\n\nThe tea application\nThe coffee application\n\n\n\ncurl resolve cafe.example.com:80:192.0.2.2 http://cafe.example.com/tea\n\nOutput should give you the similar information:\n\nServer address: 10.100.109.3:8080\nServer name: tea8697dc7b86s5vgn\nDate: 24/Aug/2022:09:27:34 +0000\nURI: /tea\nRequest ID: ed83bd555afd25c103bfa05ee12cbfff\nRemote address (NGINX Ingress Controller):\nXForwardedFor (Request source):\n\nK8S Persistent Volume status: present\n\n\n\n\ncurl resolve cafe.example.com:80:192.0.2.2 http://cafe.example.com/coffee\n\nIP address\n\nServer address: 10.100.109.0:8080\nServer name: coffee5f488998484q97z\nDate: 24/Aug/2022:09:35:57 +0000\nURI: /coffee\nRequest ID: 35e93a2538be8843c1c1fcd65b5aac4c\nRemote address (NGINX Ingress Controller):\nXForwardedFor (Request source):\n\nK8S Persistent Volume status: present\n\n\n\n\nThis result demonstrates that:\n\nYou can run applications using Docker images from the Docker cluster registry.\nYou can mount storage to pods using Persistent Volume Claim.\nThe Ingress controller provided with the cluster is configured correctly because it shows the real IP address of the request source.\n\nDelete unused resources\n\nA running cluster consumes computing resources.

The Cloud Containers service architecture, based on OpenStack, gives users a wide range of capabilities, fault tolerance, scalability and integration with other services of the platform.\n\nCluster topologies\n\nA Kubernetes Cloud Containers cluster consists of two types of nodes, master nodes and worker nodes:\n\nMaster nodes store clusterwide state information and manage workload distribution across worker nodes.\n\nWorker nodes perform the workload (workload). They can be organized into groups of worker nodes. Place groups in different availability zones to improve fault tolerance.\n\nCluster high availablity depends on the number of master nodes and their distribution across availability zones. Possible configurations:\n\nCluster of one master node.\n\n  Such a cluster is not high available: even if there are several worker nodes and they are organized in groups, the cluster will become inoperative if the single master node is lost.\n\nStandard Cloud Containers cluster of 3 or 5 master nodes.\n\n  Such a cluster is fault tolerant at the availability zone level: if the availability zone is stable and several master nodes are lost, it will remain operational as long as there is at least one working master node. The further level of fault tolerance depends on the number and configuration of worker node groups.\n\nRegional Cloud Containers cluster of 3 or 5 master nodes.\n\n  Master nodes of a regional cluster are distributed across all availability zones of a region. Such a cluster is maximally faulttolerant: if one availability zone fails, the load will be distributed between the master nodes located in other availability zones.\n\nRegardless of the cluster topology chosen, the master nodes use distributed keyvalue storage etcd to store information about the state of the cluster:\n\nA cluster with one master node has one instance of etcd.\nClusters with multiple master nodes have multiple instances of etcd running in cluster mode for high availability.\nEach etcd instance has a dedicated highperformance SSD disk (HighIOPS). This allows for the fastest possible interaction with the cluster API endpoint with minimal latency.\n\nFor high availability at the worker node level, it is recommended to create several groups of worker nodes in different availability zones and place application replicas on these nodes so that the replicas are also in different availability zones.\n\nCluster environment\n\nThe following operating systems are used on the master and worker nodes:\n\nCentOS (up to Kubernetes 1.20).\nAlmaLinux (starting with Kubernetes 1.21). AlmaLinux is a fork of CentOS.\n\nThe cluster runs containers via Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI) with CRIO (starting with Kubernetes version 1.20).\n\n\n\nBefore Kubernetes 1.19, Docker\\\\Dockershim was used to run containers and is now deprecated.\n\n\n\nSee Available Kubernetes versions and version support policy for details.\n\nIntegration with the Kubernetes API\n\nAll interaction with the cluster is through the Kubernetes API.\n\nThe Cloud Containers cluster API endpoint is placed behind dedicated load balancer, so the cluster API can be accessed via the same IP address regardless of the number of master nodes.\n\nIntegration with VK Cloud platform\n\nIntegration with the VK Cloud platform is achieved through standard Kubernetes interfaces:\n\nContainer Storage Interface (CSI): integration with storage services.\n\n  Allows to use Cloud storage in clusters as persistent volumes.\n  Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is available.\n\n  Integration is achieved using OpenStack Cinder API. See Storage in cluster for details.\n\nContainer Network Interface (CNI): integration with network services.\n\n  Every Cloud Containers cluster has a Calico plugin that supports this interface. This plugin provides:\n\n  network connectivity between containers, pods, and cluster nodes;\n  application and enforcement of Kubernetes network policies.\n\n  Calico integrates with VK Cloud platform using OpenStack Neutron API. See Network in cluster for details.\n\nBuiltin support for the Open Policy Agent\n\nPods can access various information and components of a Kubernetes cluster. With certain settings, pods themselves and the Kubernetes cluster in which they run can be vulnerable to attacks.\n\nSince Kubernetes version 1.21, Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper is built into the cluster to increase the cluster's resistance to attacks. It allows you to apply constraints, which help to increase the security of deployed workload.\n\nThese constraints are created based on constraint templates. Cloud Containers clusters already contain preconfigured templates and constraints. You can create your own templates and constraints.\n\nFor clusters below version 1.21 it is recommended to install Gatekeeper manually or upgrade the cluster to the current version.\n\nCluster scaling options\n\nThe Cloud Containers cluster has builtin scaling capabilities for master nodes and worker nodes.\n\nAutomatic scaling is also supported: if it is configured, the number of worker nodes in the cluster is automatically adjusted depending on the needs of the workload.\n","url":"/en/kubernetes/k8s/concepts/architecture","categoryPartialPath":"/en/kubernetes","description":"Service architecture details: Cloud Containers cluster topologies and environment, integration with Kubernetes API and VK Cloud platform.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Kubernetes","link":"/en/kubernetes","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Containers","link":"/en/kubernetes/k8s","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"dc21e4b3-faff-4d3a-b639-2a6b9847898a","title":"Add-ons","data":"Various addons (additional services) are available for Cloud Containers clusters. They can be selected in any combination and installed either when creating a cluster using Terraform, or later in already an existing cluster. The installation process is automated and requires minimal user intervention.\n\nheading(Features of installing addons)idfeatures_of_installing_addons\n\nAddons are installed on the worker nodes of the cluster and consume their computing resources.\n\n  The following are the system requirements of addons based on the standard values requests and limits for Kubernetes resources in the addon setup code. When using nonstandard values, the system requirements of addons will change.\n\n\n  Some addons can be installed on all cluster nodes (including master nodes). For more details, see Configuring and installing addons.\n\n\nAddons can be installed on a dedicated group of worker nodes or on Kubernetes worker nodes selected by the scheduler. Using the first approach allows you to exclude the influence of addons on the operation of production services deployed in the cluster.\n\n  The computing resources of a dedicated group of worker nodes should be sufficient for all addons, even if each addon consumes the maximum resources specified in the system requirements. It is recommended to set up automatic scaling for such a group of nodes.\n\nThere are three options for installing addons:\n\n  Standard installation on Kubernetes worker nodes selected by the scheduler with a change in the addon configuration code.\n  Installation on dedicated worker nodes with a change in the addon configuration code.\n  Quick installation on Kubernetes worker nodes selected by the scheduler without changing the addon setup code (with default settings).\n\n  Not all addons support all three installation options.\n\n  The installation process is described in the section Configuring and installing addons.\n\nheading(Available addons)idavailable_addons\n\n\n\nThe availability of specific addons depends on the region in which the cluster is planned to be placed.\n\nCapsule\n\n\n\nDescription\nSystem requirements\n\n\n\nKubernetes clusters allow you to organize the logical division of Kubernetes resources at the level of individual namespaces. However, this may not be enough to achieve resource separation and isolation in complex scenarios. For example, let's say you want to provide isolated sets of resources to multiple development teams so that they are not accessible to each other. A typical solution to this problem is to create several separate clusters for each team. With this approach, as the number of teams increases, the number of clusters also increases, which complicates the administration of these clusters.\n\nCapsule allows you to organize isolated sets of resources within one cluster using tentants. An individual tenant represents namespaces assigned to a group of users combined with restrictions on the creation and consumption of Kubernetes resources. The Capsule policy engine not only monitors compliance with resource usage policies within a tenant, but also ensures the isolation of one tenant from another. Thus, it becomes possible to organize the work of several teams within one multitenant cluster without the need to administer additional clusters.\n\n\n\n\nCPU**: 200m.\nRAM**: 128Mi.\n\ncertmanager\n\n\n\nDescription\nSystem requirements\n\n\n\ncertmanager helps to manage certificates in Kubernetes clusters:\n\nIssue certificates, including selfsigned certificates. To do this, certmanager sends requests to sources acting as certificate authority (CA).\n\n  Examples of the sources:\n\n  Cybersecurity solutions providers such as Venafi.\n  Certificate providers, such as Let’s Encrypt.\n  Storage for secrets, such as HashiCorp Vault.\n  Local containers containing the public part of a certificate and private key.\n\nAutomatically reissue expiring certificates.\n\nA certificate issued with certmanager will be available to other Kubernetes resources.

Using Istio provides traffic management for services without changing the code of the services (sidecar containers are used). Istio benefits:\n\nExpanded secure traffic transfer capabilities:\n\n  Traffic policies can be configured.\n  TLS can be used to communicate between services.\n\nExpanded traffic monitoring capabilities.\nComplex routing and balancing of traffic between services can be done.\n\n\n\n\nCPU**: 500m.\nRAM**: 2Gi.\n\nheading(Jaeger)idjaeger\n\n\n\nDescription\nSystem requirements\n\n\n\nIn distributed systems based on microservices, requests are constantly exchanged. The Jaeger platform created for distributed query tracing. Jaeger tracks the flow of requests through microservices and allows you to:\n\ncollect information about the interrelationships of the system components in terms of the flow of requests;\ndetect query problems or bottlenecks in the system architecture related to processing the request stream.\n\nSuch a tool is necessary because queryrelated factors can significantly affect the behavior and performance of these systems as a whole. It is not enough to provide monitoring only for individual microservices.\n\nJaeger performs query tracing based on the data it receives from microservices. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate into microservices tool stack OpenTelemetry to send data about requests. You can get acquainted with the integration of OpenTelemetry into a microservice application using the example of Hot R.O.D.\n\n\n\n\nAddon requirements:\n\nThe number of worker nodes must be at least the selected number of Elasticsearch replicas.\n\n  Elasticsearch is used as a backend for storage. Each Elasticsearch replica will be hosted on a separate worker node to ensure fault tolerance.\n\n  For more information about choosing the number of replicas, see section about installing Jaeger.\n\nWorker nodes must use the configuration of computing resources:\n\n  STD244 or better (for a test environment);\n  STD266 or better (for a production environment).\n\nRequirements of individual addon components:\n\nElasticsearch:\n\n  CPU: 100m–1000m.\n  RAM: 512M.\n\nAgent:\n\n  CPU: 250m–500m.\n  RAM: 128M–512M.\n\nCollector:\n\n  CPU: 500m–1000m.\n  RAM: 512M–1024M.\n\nQuery:\n\n  CPU: 250m–500m.\n  RAM: 128M–512M.\n\n\n\nTo ensure stable operation of Jaeger, it is recommended to install it on a dedicated group of worker nodes that meets the above requirements.\n\nKiali\n\n\n\nDescription\nSystem requirements\n\n\n\nKiali is a web interface for working with Istio.

This server provides discovery of services in the cluster and allows them to be addressed by their DNS names.\n\nCoreDNS also exports metrics to Prometheus, which allows you to monitor its performance through cluster monitoring tools.\n\nWorking with Container Network Interface (CNI)\n\nCloud Containers clusters use Calico to organize the intracluster network. Calico communicates with the VK Cloud platform using the OpenStack Neutron API. The platform itself uses a softwaredefined network Neutron.\n\nWhen using OpenStack Neutron in large cloud networks (about tens of thousands of network ports per network), there are problems with convergence speed if at least a few network members fail. Synchronization of topology changes in a network of this size takes a long time, which negatively affects its performance.\n\nTherefore, VK Cloud has developed its own softwaredefined network, Sprut. It is fully compatible with Neutron API but works on different principles, which allows to use it together with Calico in large cloud networks without experiencing the described issues. Read more about Sprut in How cloud networks work and how they differ from Onpremise and in YouTube video.\n\n\n\nSprut is in the beta testing phase. Contact technical support to get access to the new SDN service.\n\nIntegration with load balancers\n\nCloud Containers cluster integrates with the load balancers of the VK Cloud platform. This applies to both regular Kubernetes load balancers (LoadBalancer) and Ingress controllers (IngressController): both will have a dedicated VK Cloud TCP balancer attached to them both when created. This also applies to the Ingress controller, which is installed as an addon.\n\nIf necessary, you can use the HTTP load balancer. See example for Ingress controller for details.\n\nThe VK Cloud platform load balancer is based on OpenStack Octavia, which has HAProxy at its core and supports:\n\nproxying and balancing HTTP and TCP connections (the latter including proxyprotocol support);\nproxying and balancing HTTP/2 connections in addition to HTTP/1.1;\ntermination of SSL connections at the balancer.\n\nFor high availability, two instances of the balancer are deployed, one in active mode and one in standby mode. State synchronization and traffic switching between these balancers takes place using the VRRP protocol. The cluster treats such a highavailable configuration as a single load balancer.\n\nIngress controller and real user IP address detection\n\nSometimes when using the Ingress controller, the pod in the cluster needs to see the real IP address of the user who sent the original request to the balancer, not the IP address of the balancer itself. This can be important for some kinds of network applications.\n\nTo allow a pod that is placed behind the Ingress controller to see the user's real IP address, use one of the options:\n\nIngress controller with proxy protocol support.\n\n  If you plan to handle HTTPS traffic, configure SSL connection termination on this Ingress controller because the TCP balancer that will be created for the controller cannot terminate SSL connections itself.\n\n  The NGINXbased Ingress Controller provided by VK Cloud supports the proxy protocol and is already configured to work with it.\n\nSeparate HTTP\\HTTPS balancer with additional settings:\n\n  If you plan to handle HTTPS traffic, configure SSL connection termination on this balancer.\n  Activate the ExternalTrafficPolicy: Local policy on the Ingress controller.\n\n  In this case only HTTP traffic will flow to the Ingress controller, which will show all headers, including the sender's IP address (if any).\n\nDefault network objects\n\nWhen a Kubernetes cluster is created, several network objects are created for it.\n\nLoad balancer for Kubernetes API\n\nA dedicated TCP load balancer is created for each cluster, which handles incoming requests to the Kubernetes API for all master nodes. This load balancer is used to connect to and manage the cluster.\n\nFirewall rules\n\nThree groups of rules are created for each cluster:\n\nbase: allow communication between master nodes and groups of worker nodes.\nmaster: allow communication with the master nodes.\nminion: provide communication between groups of worker nodes.\n\n\n\nChanging these rule groups may render the cluster inoperable.\n\nSee also\n\nContainer service overview.\nContainer service architecture.\nStorage in a cluster.\n","url":"/en/kubernetes/k8s/concepts/network","categoryPartialPath":"/en/kubernetes","description":"Each Cloud Containers cluster is tightly integrated with VK Cloud network services.

There are problems with storing data in a container:\n\nIf the container crashes or stops, data is lost.\nContainer data is inaccessible to other containers, even if all containers are in the same pod.\n\nTo solve these problems, Cloud Containers volumes are used. Volumes have different lifecycles depending on the usage scenario:\n\nEphemeral volumes (EVs) have the same lifecycle as a pod. When a pod using such a volume ceases to exist, the volume is also deleted. Ephemeral volumes can only be used by a single pod, so volumes are declared directly in the pod's manifest.\n\nPersistent volumes (PVs) have their own lifecycle, independent of the pod's lifecycle. Due to the separation of lifecycles, such volumes can be reused later with other pods. Pods and other workloads use Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) to handle persistent volumes.\n\nCloud Containers do not support ReadWriteMany (RWX) access to Persistent Volume Claims. This means that you cannot simultaneously write data to a single PV from multiple pods on different nodes.\n\nTo share data between pods on different nodes, deploy an NFS server on a separate VM. An NFS server shares data over the network, allowing multiple pods to simultaneously read and write data to a shared volume.\n\nCloud Containers clusters are tightly integrated with the VK Cloud platform to handle PVs:\n\nThe cluster supports storage provided by the VK Cloud platform. Block storage support is implemented using Cinder CSI.\nPreconfigured storage classes that implement different persistent volume reclaim policies are available for block storage in the cluster.\n\nheading(Supported VK Cloud storage types)idstorage_types\n\nBlock storages:\n\n  Based on Ceph. To ensure fault tolerance and data integrity, the storage consists of three replicas located in different server racks. The storage uses SSD disks.\n\n  Based on highperformance NVMe SSD disks (HighIOPS SSD). Such storage is connected via iSCSI. Hardware RAID10 is used to provide fault tolerance and data integrity at the storage level.\n\nFile Storage connected via NFS and CIFS.\n\nWorking with Container Storage Interface (CSI)\n\nKubernetes clusters use OpenStack Cinder to integrate with block storage in VK Cloud.\n\nThe storage types available in a Kubernetes cluster via Cinder CSI correlate with VK Cloud block storage as follows:\n\nCeph SSD corresponds to cephssd in Cinder.\nHighIOPS SSD corresponds to highiops in Cinder.\n\nUsing Cinder CSI allows you to:\n\nStatically and dynamically provision PV that is based on block storage.\n\nAutomatically remount persistent volumes:\n  When the pod using the volume or the worker node hosting the pod fails (assuming the pod is restored to that node or another node).\n  When you migrate a pod using a volume from one worker node to another.\n\nManage the storage that is used by PV:\n  When a volume is dynamically provisioned, the disk corresponding to that volume in VK Cloud will be automatically created.\n  If the Delete reclaim policy is set for a volume, the associated volume and the corresponding disk in VK Cloud will be deleted after the PVC is deleted.\n\nAvailable reclaim policies for persistent volumes\n\nA reclaim policy can be set for a PV. The policy will be triggered when the PVC associated with that volume is deleted:\n\nKeep the volume (Retain). The PV and its associated storage will not be deleted.\n\n  This policy applies to both block and file storage. Use it for PVs with sensitive data to protect the data if the PVC is accidentally deleted. If necessary, you can manually clean up and delete PVs with this policy and their associated storage.\n\nDelete the volume (Delete). The PV and its associated storage will be deleted.\n\n  This policy is only applicable to block storage.\n\n\n  Use this policy and the storage classes that implement it with caution: deleting a PVC will cause the PV and the disk corresponding to that volume to be deleted.\n\n\nPreconfigured storage classes\n\nWhen using dynamic provisioning of a persistent volume, a storage class should be specified. The default storage class is not configured in VK Cloud Kubernetes clusters. It is possible either to set the default class manually, or explicitly specify the required class when creating a PVC.\n\nThere are preconfigured storage classes that use Cinder CSI for block storage.\n\nThe classes provide different types of storage in multiple regions and availability zones.\nEach storage class has a distinct reclaim policy confugured for it.\n\n\n\nMoscow region\n\n\n\n Storage classname            Cinder CSIstorage type   Availabilityzone  ReclaimPolicy \n        \n csicephssdgz1                 cephssd                   GZ1                  Delete            \n csicephssdgz1retain          cephssd                   GZ1                  Retain            \n csicephssdms1                 cephssd                   MS1                  Delete            \n csicephssdms1retain          cephssd                   MS1                  Retain            \n csicephssdme1                 cephssd                   ME1                  Delete            \n csicephssdme1retain          cephssd                   ME1                  Retain            \n csihighiopsgz1                highiops                  GZ1                  Delete            \n csihighiopsgz1retain         highiops                  GZ1                  Retain            \n csihighiopsms1                highiops                  MS1                  Delete            \n csihighiopsms1retain         highiops                  MS1                  Retain            \n csihighiopsme1                highiops                  ME1                  Delete            \n csihighiopsme1retain         highiops                  ME1                  Retain            \n\n\n\n\nAll storage classes listed:\n\nAllow volume expansion (allowVolumeExpansion: true).\nUse immediate volume provisioning and binding (volumeBindingMode: Immediate).\n\nSee also\n\nContainer service overview.\nContainer service architecture.\nNetwork in a cluster.\n","url":"/en/kubernetes/k8s/concepts/storage","categoryPartialPath":"/en/kubernetes","description":"Each Cloud Containers cluster is tightly integrated with storage services and allows you to create persistent volumes based on them.

Some of the templates are available immediately, and some are available upon request to technical support.\n\nRecommendations for choosing CPU and RAM for clusters:\n\nFor small test clusters: 1 vCPU, 2 or 4 GB RAM.\n\nFor most clusters: 2 to 6 vCPUs, 2 to 24 GB RAM.\n\nFor highperformance clusters: 8 to 16 vCPUs, 8 to 64 GB RAM.\n\nThe following templates becomes available upon request to technical support:\n\n*Templates with highperformance CPUs: from 16 vCPUs, from 64 GB RAM. These CPUs are more powerful.\n\nCustomized configurations templates for special needs.\n\n\n\nCost highperformance and customized of configurations is calculated individually.\n\nCalculating the right cluster configuration\n\nFor a Kubernetes cluster to work stably:\n\nEstimate the amount of resources required for the planned workload.\nCreate a cluster with the following parameters:\n\n   Number of vCPUs: 510% more than the estimated number for the planned workload.\n   Amount of RAM: 20% more than the estimated amount for your planned load.\n   Storage capacity: 10% more than the planned load.\n   Storage type: Ceph SSD or HighIOPS SSD.\n   Number of master nodes: odd number for high avalability configuration (at least three).\n   Number of worker nodes: 10% more than the calculated number for the planned load.\n\nCalculation of available CPU and RAM computing resources\n\nEach node in a Kubernetes cluster runs a kubelet agent. Kubelets, system processes, and the operating system itself require a certain amount of resources, meaning not all node resources are available to run containers.\n\nIn most cases, CPU resources are reserved as follows:\n\n6% of the first core\n1% of the second core (up to 2 cores)\n0.5% of the third and fourth cores (up to 4 cores)\n0.25% of all cores above four\n\nMemory reservation is usually arranged like this:\n\n25% of the first 4 GB of memory\n20% of the next 4 GB (up to 8 GB)\n10% of the next 8 GB (up to 16 GB)\n6% of the next 112 GB (up to 128 GB)\n2% of any memory above 128 GB\n\nIn addition to reserved resources, system pods are created on the nodes, which run constantly and also consume memory:\n\n Pod name  CPU Requests  CPU Limits  RAM Requests  RAM Limits \n          \n caliconode  100m  0  512 Mi  0 \n csicindernodeplugin  75 m  300 m  96 Mi  384 Mi \n haproxy  20 m  800 m  80 Mi  500 Mi \n\nThe eviction threshold is typically 100 MB. This is the amount of free memory on a node, below which the kubelet begins to evict pods due to lack of memory.\n\nLarger nodes can use resources more efficiently due to lower percentage reservations compared to smaller nodes. However, scaling the cluster will require time to launch additional nodes. As new nodes are added, the time required to deploy and cache container images will increase, which is critical to maintaining fault tolerance.\n\nThe number of pods launched on a node affects the performance of the cluster. You can run a maximum of 110 pods, but for best node performance, plan for 30–40 pods per node.\n\nWhen choosing the size of nodes and their number in a cluster, choose a distribution that maximizes resource utilization and maintains the required level of fault tolerance and scalability.\n\n\n\nIf you change the VM type for a group of nodes, the reserved resources are not changed, as they are set when the node is created.\n\nAvailable computing resources on the node\n\nAvailable CPU resources on the node:\n\nNode CPU \tCPU Available \n    \n 1  0,94 \n 2  1,93 \n 4 \t3,92 \n 6  5,915 \n 8 \t7,91 \n 12  11,9 \n 16  15,89 \n\nДоступные ресурсы RAM на узле:\n\n Node RAM (GB)  Node RAM Capacity (Ki) \tRAM Allocatable (Ki)\t RAM Allocatable (Mi) \n        \n 2  2 005 132  1 641 612  1 603 \n 4  4 000 132  2 849 156  2 782 \n 6  6 056 116  4 905 140  4 790 \n 8 \t8 122 536  6 132 699  5 989 \n 12 \t12 238 576 \t10 248 739  10 009 \n 16  16 365 320  13 536 622 \t13 219 \n 18  18 406 708 \t15 452 181  15 090 \n 24  24 599 856  21 267 842  20 769 \n 32  32 856 944  29 021 613  28 341 \n 36  36 935 672  32 848 683  32 079 \n 48  49 321 092  44 479 128  43 437 \n 64  65 836 152 \t59 987 556  58 582 \n","url":"/en/kubernetes/k8s/concepts/flavors","categoryPartialPath":"/en/kubernetes","description":"When creating Cloud Containers cluster nodes, multiple virtual machine configurations with different compute resources can be used.

In this way, you can manage the computing resources of the cluster without affecting the virtual machine templates that are used by the nodes.\n\nBoth types of scaling are performed manually. Autoscaling also works.\n\nheading(Autoscaling)idautoscaling\n\nVertical autoscaling of master nodes works for all clusters, you cannot disable it.\n\nVertical autoscaling agent evaluates the master node load by CPU and RAM, monitoring the following threshold values:\n\nCPU load exceeds 80% for 60 seconds\nCPU load exceeds 60% for 5 minutes\nRAM load exceeds 90% for 60 seconds\n\nIf at least one of the thresholds is exceeded, a request will be sent to the Cloud Containers service to change the master node VM flavor. In this case, the CPU and RAM values ​​will be doubled. For example, the flavor STD226 will be changed to STD2412.\n\nYou can change the master node VM flavor to a flavor with smaller CPU and RAM only in manual mode.\n\nYou can configure horizontal autoscaling for a group of nodes. The number of worker nodes in the group will be automatically adjusted depending on the needs of the workload. This mechanism allows you to save up to 60% on computing power.\n\nCurrent restrictions\n\nVertical scaling capabilities are limited by current quotas and available virtual machine templates.\nHorizontal scaling capabilities are limited by the current quotas and the limit on the number of worker nodes in a separate node group: from 1 to 100 nodes.\nIt is not possible to perform horizontal scaling manually if automatic scaling is configured. To perform manual scaling, turn off automatic scaling.\n\nEnsuring accessibility with vertical scaling\n\nWhen vertically scaling any cluster nodes, the virtual machines that are used by the nodes are sequentially restarted. This is necessary to apply the new virtual machine template. Therefore, the scaling process affects the availability of both the cluster API and the workloads hosted in the cluster:\n\nIf the cluster is not faulttolerant and contains a single master node, then the Kubernetes API will be unavailable until scaling is completed.\nIf a node group contains only one worker node, then the workload hosted on it will be unavailable until scaling is completed.\nIf a node group contains multiple worker nodes, the workload hosted on them will not be available until scaling is complete if replication for the load is not configured or configured incorrectly.\n\n  For example, if you place all replicas on one worker node, then when it is restarted, the workload will become unavailable, even if there are other worker nodes in the node group.\n\n  Configure replication so that some of the workload replicas are available when worker nodes are restarted.\n\nIf there are not enough computing resources for the workload after scaling the node group, then this load may not work correctly or become unavailable.\n\n  Make sure that when scaling down computing resources, the total amount of resources in the node group is sufficient.\n","url":"/en/kubernetes/k8s/concepts/scale","categoryPartialPath":"/en/kubernetes","description":"How the cluster can adapt to the demands of the workload.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Kubernetes","link":"/en/kubernetes","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Containers","link":"/en/kubernetes/k8s","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"4c3df781-0296-4176-a968-28af79bf14f3","title":"Cluster version update","data":"For Kubernetes clusters with version 1.17.8 and higher, a Kubernetes version update operation to one of supported versions is available in VK Cloud. You cannot downgrade versions.\n\nClusters of versions 1.16 and lower can only be updated by transferring a backup of data to a new cluster of the required version, for example, using Velero.\n\nDuring a cluster update the following entities also are updated:\n\nInstalled addons.\nPart of the cluster components:\n\n  CoreDNS.\n\n    When CoreDNS is updating, the current Corefile is overwritten with the new one with default settings.\n\n    If the cluster uses a modified Corefile, then back it up prior to updating the cluster.\n\n  Gatekeeper.\n  Shell Operator.\n  Kubernetes Dashboard.\n\n  If a component, that is to be updated with the cluster, is deleted, then it will be restored during the next cluster update.\n\nUpdating is done as follows:\n\nMaster nodes are updated. The updating is performed according to the principle of rolling update (stepbystep):\n\n   The first master node is updated: it is removed from the cluster, updated, checked for successful update, and returned back to the cluster.\n   As soon as the updated master node returned to the cluster, the next node is updated. Consequently, one node at a time, all cluster master nodes are updated.\n\nWorker nodes in groups are updated.\n\n   The procedure also follows the rolling update principle (stepbystep), but in one step updates not a single node but the maximum possible number of nodes. This number is calculated based on the node group setting Percentage of unavailable nodes when updating the cluster. The calculations use rounding to integers upwards.\n\n   How to choose the value of the setting:\n\n   Suppose:\n   The cluster has a group of nine worker nodes that run businesscritical workloads. These services and applications must be available throughout the upgrade process.\n   The workload requires at least six nodes, i.e., three nodes can be allowed to update at the same time.\n\n   To select the setting value:\n\n   Calculate what percentage of nodes are allowed to update. To do this, divide the maximum number of nodes that are allowed to update by the total number of nodes, and multiply by 100:\n\n      (3 / 9) x 100  33,33333...%\n\n   Round down the result. This will be the optimal setting:\n\n      9 x 33%  2,97\n\n      The resulting fractional result will be rounded to a whole number upwards. Total you can update three nodes out of nine at the same time, which satisfies the requirements.\n\n   Set the setting value:\n\n      either strictly equal to the calculated percentage so that the maximum allowed number of nodes is updated;\n      or less than the calculated percentage so that fewer nodes are updated.\n\n      In the example above:\n      A setting of 33% will update three nodes at a time;\n      Setting it to 20% will update two nodes at a time;\n      A setting of 10% will update one node at a time.\n","url":"/en/kubernetes/k8s/concepts/update","categoryPartialPath":"/en/kubernetes","description":"How the Kubernetes Cloud Containers cluster update procedure is arranged.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Kubernetes","link":"/en/kubernetes","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Containers","link":"/en/kubernetes/k8s","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"2b68d53f-6843-41ab-98be-f9e078644aca","title":"Kubernetes version support policy","data":"New versions of Kubernetes aaS from VK Cloud are usually added 1 month after the official release.\n\nThe following versions of Kubernetes aaS from VK Cloud are currently available:\n\n1.29.7\n1.28.9\n1.27.6\n1.26.5\n\nWhen creating a new cluster, choose the latest available version of Kubernetes.

This file contains all the user's details, except for the password (it is not specified for security reasons). Therefore, when using kubectl, the keystoneauth utility will require you to enter the user's password interactively in order to authenticate:\n\nPlease enter password:\n\nAfter successful authentication, a token with a short lifetime is issued, which gives temporary access to the cluster. When the token expires, keystoneauth will require you to enter the password again in order to update the token. This will happen both when working with kubectl and with other tools that work with such tokens — for example, kauthproxy uses them for authentication in the web interfaces of cluster components and addons.\n\nThis authentication process is inconvenient when working with automated tools that need access to the cluster. To provide access to the cluster for such tools, create a kubeconfig file for the service account. This kubeconfig contains the details of the service account and the corresponding token with an infinite lifetime, which allows you to authenticate without entering a password.\n\nheading(Relationship between the roles of management console and Kubernetes)idkubernetesrolesrelation\n\n\n\nKubernetes Auditor\nKubernetes Operator\nProject OwnerProject AdministratorSuper AdministratorKubernetes Administrator\n\n\n\nKubernetes role: view.\n\nThe role provides read access to most objects in the namespace.\n\nThe role does not provide:\n\nAbility to view or change roles and role bindings.\nAccess to secrets.\n\n  A user with access to secrets can access the credentials of any service account in the namespace.

Fault tolerance is provided at the zone level.\n     Regional: cluster master nodes will be located in each of the three availability zones, which allows maintaining control even if one of the zones fails. The total number of master nodes is 3 or more.\n\n   Master node settings:\n\n     Category of virtual machine: select the flavor of the VM. For more information, see Cloud Servers service overview.\n\n     Virtual machine type  Master: virtual machine template for master nodes.\n\n       Templates with highperformance CPUs are available upon request to support.

One node does not provide cluster high availability at the master node level, three nodes or more do. The numer of master nodes for the regional cluster is automatically set to 3.\n\n       For more information about cluster topologies, see Architecture.\n\n     Disk size on Master node: the larger the disk size, the better its performance in some disk operations.\n\n   Network settings:\n\n     Network: select the network and subnet where the cluster master and worker nodes will be located. If the required network and subnet are not on the list, create them.\n\n     Use load balancer network: enable this option to use a separate subnet on the selected network for load balancers created by the cluster. If the required subnet is not on the list, create it.\n\n       By default, the option is disabled and the load balancers use the same subnet as the cluster nodes.\n\n     Use pod subnet: enable this option to specify the subnet that the pods will use to communicate with each other.\n\n       By default, the pods use the 10.100.0.0./16 subnet for communication. If such a subnet already exists in the cluster network, specify a different subnet that is not part of the cluster network, to be used by the pods. This is necessary so that there is no address space overlap.\n\n     Assign external IP: enable this option so that external IP addresses are assigned to the cluster API endpoint and the preinstalled Ingress controller (if selected in the previous step). Otherwise IP addresses will be assigned from the cluster subnet.\n\n       By default, the option is enabled, which allows access to the cluster and the Ingress controller from the Internet.\n\n   Miscellaneous settings:\n\n     Trusted Docker Registry: add Docker Registry addresses to the trusted list to disable HTTPS connection check when connecting to them.\n\n       This comes in handy if the Docker registry uses a selfsigned SSL or TLS certificate that cannot be validated by the cluster.\n\n       See Docker documentation for more information on disabling the validation (see the description of the insecureregistries setting).\n\n     Virtual machine key: SSH key, with which you can connect to the cluster hosts. The recommended value is No key.\n\n\n       Limited scope\n\n       This setting is only available for clusters with Kubernetes version 1.22.9 and lower.\n\n\n     Enable monitoring: enable this option to install a metrics collection agent in the cluster.\n\n       By default, the option is enabled and allows you to monitor the state of the cluster using the Cloud Monitoring service.\n\nClick the Next step button.\n\n3. Configure the node groups\n\nSet the settings for the worker node group.\n\nIf necessary, add one or more workernode groups by clicking Add node group, and configure them.\n\nIf more than one worker node group is configured at this step, you can delete a node group by clicking Delete node group under the appropriate group.\n\nClick the Create cluster button.\n\n   This will start creating the Kubernetes cluster. This process may take a long time, depending on the size of the cluster.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nSet up the environment on the host from which you plan to connect to the cluster.\nFamiliarize yourself with the usage scenarios of the cluster.\nFamiliarize yourself with the concepts of the container service.\n","url":"/en/kubernetes/k8s/service-management/create-cluster/create-webui","categoryPartialPath":"/en/kubernetes","description":"How to create a cluster from VK Cloud management console.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Kubernetes","link":"/en/kubernetes","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Containers","link":"/en/kubernetes/k8s","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"8f9de6cc-852b-4c03-928d-53f48a3f807a","title":"Creating a cluster with Terraform","data":"Description of how to create a cluster using Terraform is provided below.

This metadata contains, among other things, the severity level of logged events.\n   Learn more about metadata for determining the source of logs\r\n\r\n   For each log entry, identifiers are set that allow you to determine the source of logs when using Cloud Logging:\r\n\r\n   Resource group ID (groupid): the name of the cluster.\r\n   The resource ID (streamid) in one of the formats:\r\n\r\n     For kubelet component: ..\r\n\r\n       Example:\r\n\r\n       `text\r\n       myclusternode0.kubelet.service\r\n       `\r\n\r\n     For pod: ..\r\n\r\n       First, the name is searched in the following labels:\r\n\r\n       app.kubernetes.io/instance (more about label);\r\n       app.kubernetes.io/name (more about label);\r\n       app;\r\n       k8sapp.\r\n\r\n       If there are no such labels, then the name of the pod is used.\r\n\r\n       Example:\r\n\r\n       Let:\r\n\r\n       In the namespace kubesystem there is a pod named kubecontrollermanagermyclustermaster0.\r\n       The label k8sappkubecontrollermanager is set for this pod.\r\n\r\n       Then the resource identifier will look like:\r\n\r\n       `text\r\n       kubesystem.kubecontrollermanager\r\n       `\n   Learn more about other metadata with additional information about logs\r\n\r\n   Metadata fields with additional information about the logged event are added to log entries, which allows you to search in Cloud Logging, including by log metadata:\r\n\r\n   node_name: the name of the cluster node where the kubelet service or pod is located.\r\n   severity: the severity level of the logged event in text form.\r\n   severity_num: the severity level of the logged event in number form.\r\n   All fields of the JSON message: if logs are written in JSON format, then all fields of the JSON message, except msg, are added as metadata.\nYou can finetune the behavior of the addon when working with severity levels using:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCustom filters\r\nCustom patterns\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSet one or more rules for custom CustomFilter filters in the addon code so that only logs with the specified minimum severity level get into Cloud Logging. These rules can be configured at the level of a specific namespace and at the level of specific pods in the namespace:\r\n\r\n\r\n`yaml\r\ncustomFilter:\r\n  namespace:\n    rules: # One rule for the namespace\r\n      min_level:\n  namespace:\n    rules: # A few rules for the pods in the namespace\r\n      podprefix:\n        min_level:\n      podprefix:\n        min_level:\n  namespace:\n    rules: # A combination of namespace rules and pod rules\r\n      min_level:\n      podprefix:\n        min_level:\n      podprefix:\n        min_level:\n`\r\n\r\nIt is the prefix that is configured for the pods so that you can receive logs from several replica pods that relate to the same workload.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\nThe only rule applies at the level of the kubesystem namespace.\r\n\r\n   Only those logs from this namespace that have a severity level of WARN or higher (ERROR, FATAL) will get into Cloud Logging.\r\n\r\nThe only rule applies at the level of the pods that are in the default namespace, and whose names begin with the prefix testpod.\r\n\r\n   Only those logs from these pods that have a severity level of ERROR or higher (FATAL) will get into Cloud Logging. Logs are not filtered at the default namespace level.\r\n\r\nSeveral rules apply at the level of the mynamespace namespace and at the level of the examplepod prefixed pods that are located in this namespace.\r\n\r\n   Only the listed logs will be included in Cloud Logging:\r\n\r\n   Logs from the namespace that do not belong to pods with the prefix examplepod and have a severity level of ERROR or higher (FATAL).\r\n   Logs from the pods with the prefix examplepod, which have a severity level of WARN or higher (ERROR, FATAL).\r\n\r\n\r\n`yaml\r\ncustomFilter:\r\n  namespace: kubesystem\r\n    rules:\r\n      min_level: WARN\r\n  namespace: default\r\n    rules:\r\n      podprefix: testpod\r\n        min_level: ERROR\r\n  namespace: mynamespace\r\n    rules:\r\n      min_level: ERROR\r\n      podprefix: examplepod\r\n        min_level: WARN\r\n`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSet one or more rules for custom customRegexp pattern in the addon code to set the required severity level for logs bypassing the standard addon mechanisms. If part of the log entry matches the specified Lua pattern, then this record is assigned the severity level specified in the rule. If there are no matches, then the record is assigned a severity level determined using the Fluent Bit parsers. This can be useful if the automatic level detection mechanism used in the addon incorrectly determines the log level of a particular application.\r\n\r\nThese rules apply at the level of a certain namespace and at the level of certain pods in the namespace:\r\n\r\n\r\n`yaml\r\ncustomRegexp:\r\n  namespace:\n    rules:\r\n    levels: # One rule for a namespace: setting up multiple levels\r\n      level:\n        reg_exp: \"\"\r\n      level:\n        reg_exp: \"\"\r\n  namespace:\n    rules: # Several rules for the pods in the namespace: setting up multiple levels\r\n    podprefix:  # The first rule for pods\r\n      levels:\r\n      level:\n        reg_exp: \"\"\r\n      level:\n        reg_exp: \"\"\r\n    podprefix:  # The second rule for pods\r\n      levels:\r\n      level:\n        reg_exp: \"\"\r\n  namespace:\n    rules:\r\n    levels: # The first rule for a namespace is to set up multiple levels\r\n      level:\n        reg_exp: \"\"\r\n      level:\n        reg_exp: \"\"\r\n    podprefix:  # The second rule for pods: setting up multiple levels\r\n      levels:\r\n      level:\n        reg_exp: \"\"\r\n      level:\n        reg_exp: \"\"\r\n`\r\n\r\nIt is the prefix that is configured for the pods so that you can receive logs from several replica pods that relate to the same workload.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\nThe only rule applies at the level of the kubesystem namespace.\r\n\r\n   If part of the log entry from this namespace matches the specified pattern Ww%d%d%d%d%s+, then this entry will be assigned the ERROR severity level.\r\n\r\nThe only rule applies at the level of the pods that are in the default namespace, and whose names begin with the prefix testpod.\r\n\r\n   If a part of the log entry from these pods matches the specified pattern this is a plain text message, then this entry will be assigned the WARN severity level.\r\n\r\nSeveral rules apply at the level of the mynamespace namespace and at the level of the examplepod prefixed pods that are located in this namespace.\r\n\r\n   The severity levels will be assigned according to the following rules:\r\n\r\n   If a part of the log record from this namespace (which does not belong to the pods with the prefix examplepod) matches the specified pattern Ww%s+, then this record will be assigned the ERROR severity level.\r\n   If a part of the log record from the pods with the prefix examplepod matches the specified pattern Debug trace, then this record will be assigned the DEBUG severity level.\r\n\r\nIf no part of the log record matches the specified patterns, then such a record is assigned a severity level determined using Fluent Bit parsers.\r\n\r\n\r\n`yaml\r\ncustomRegexp:\r\n  namespace: kubesystem\r\n    rules:\r\n    levels:\r\n      level: ERROR\r\n        reg_exp: \"Ww%d%d%d%d%s+\"\r\n  namespace: default\r\n    rules:\r\n    podprefix: testpod\r\n      levels:\r\n      level: WARN\r\n        reg_exp: \"this is a plain text message\"\r\n  namespace: mynamespace\r\n    rules:\r\n    levels:\r\n      level: ERROR\r\n        reg_exp: \"Ww%s+\"\r\n    podprefix: examplepod\r\n      levels:\r\n      level: DEBUG\r\n        reg_exp: \"Debug trace\"\r\n`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","url":"/en/kubernetes/k8s/service-management/addons/advanced-installation/install-advanced-logaas-integration","categoryPartialPath":"/en/kubernetes","description":"This section describes how to configure and install the Fluent Bit add-on for Cloud Logging (logaas-integration).","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Kubernetes","link":"/en/kubernetes","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Containers","link":"/en/kubernetes/k8s","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"2b6ffc85-38a5-4a34-8021-13ac4fafc0b5","title":"Ingress NGINX","data":"heading(Installing addon)idinstalling_addon\n\n\n\nWhen installing the addon, standard load balancers will be created for them.\n\nUsage of this load balancer is charged.\n\n\n\nSeveral installation options are available for the addon.\n\nTake into account the total maximum system requirements of addons that will be placed on groups of worker nodes.

Deploy demo applications\n\nThese applications will be accessed through the Ingress controller using the Ingress resource.\n\nThe tea and coffee applications from NGINX's Cafe example will be used for the demo. Each application consists of a ReplicaSet, a Deployment and a Service corresponding to that Deployment.\n\nTo deploy the demo applications:\n\nDownload the cafe.yaml manifest(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/kubernetesingress/v2.4.0/examples/ingressresources/completeexample/cafe.yaml).\n\nApply this manifest to the cluster:\n\n      kubectl apply f ./cafe.yaml\n\nTo check the status of the application components, run the command:\n\nkubectl get svc,rs,deployment n default\n\nThe output of the command should be similar to this one:\n\nNAME                 TYPE        CLUSTERIP       EXTERNALIP   PORT(S)   AGE\nservice/coffeesvc   ClusterIP   ...                      80/TCP    ...\nservice/teasvc      ClusterIP   ...                      80/TCP    ...\n\nNAME                                DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE\nreplicaset.apps/coffee7c86d7d67c   2         2         2       ...\nreplicaset.apps/tea5c457db9        3         3         3       ...\n\nNAME                     READY   UPTODATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\ndeployment.apps/coffee   2/2     2            2           ...\ndeployment.apps/tea      3/3     3            3           ...\n\n3. Install Ingress Controller\n\nWhen installing, select PROXY operation mode as it is necessary for full interaction with the TCP load balancer. If you install an Ingress controller without support for this protocol, the controller will not be able to handle headers that contain information about the request source.\n\nTo install an NGINX Ingress Controller with PROXY protocol support:\n\nAdd the NGINX Helm repository:\n\n   Linux/macOS\n   Windows\n\n\n      helm repo add nginxstable https://helm.nginx.com/stable\n   helm repo update\n\n\n      helm repo add nginxstable https://helm.nginx.com/stable; `\n   helm repo update\n\n\nInstall a PROXYenabled Ingress controller by running the command:\n\n      helm install nginxingresstcp nginxstable/nginxingress setstring 'controller.config.entries.useproxyprotocoltrue' createnamespace namespace examplenginxingresstcp\n\nWait until the installation of the Ingress controller is complete and the controller receives an external IP address.\n\n   To check the status of the Ingress controller, run the command:\n\n      kubectl get svc n examplenginxingresstcp\n\n   The output of the command should be similar to this one:\n\n      NAME                              TYPE           CLUSTERIP    EXTERNALIP                                   PORT(S)    AGE\n   nginxingresstcpnginxingress   LoadBalancer   ...               ...        ...\n\nCheck if the Ingress controller is working by browsing to http://. If the controller is configured correctly, a page with the status of HTTP 404 will be displayed.\n\n4. Create an Ingress resource\n\nThe Ingress resource will publish the coffeesvc and teasvc services through the Ingress controller, thus providing access to the applications.\n\nThe following is a demonstration of how to create an Ingress resource with SSL/TLS sessions termination on the Ingress controller.\n\nTo create an Ingress resource:\n\nCreate a Kubernetes secret that will contain the certificate data. This will be used by the Ingress controller when handling HTTPS traffic.\n\n   This secret contains the public and private parts of the NGINX selfsigned certificate, which is used to access the published applications in the cafe.example.com domain.\n\n\n   The private part of this certificate is publicly available on the Internet, so do not use this certificate to protect real applications in a production environment.\n\n   .\n\nDownload the cafesecret.yaml manifest (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/kubernetesingress/v2.4.0/examples/ingressresources/completeexample/cafesecret.yaml).\n\nApply this manifest to the cluster:\n\n      kubectl apply f ./cafesecret.yaml\n\n   The cafesecret secret will be created.\n\nCheck that the secret has been successfully created by running the command:\n\n      kubectl describe secret cafesecret\n\n   The basic information about the secret will be shown.\n\nCreate an Ingress resource which will handle incoming requests to host cafe.example.com:\n\n   Download the cafeingress.yaml manifest.\n\n   Apply this manifest to the cluster:\n\n            kubectl apply f ./cafeingress.yaml\n\n        The cafeingress Ingress resource will be created.\n\n   Check that the resource was successfully created by running the command:\n\n      kubectl describe ingress cafeingress\n\n   The output of the command should be similar to this one:\n\n      Name:             cafeingress\n   Labels:\n   Namespace:        default\n   Address:\n   Ingress Class:    nginx\n   Default backend:\n   TLS:\n     cafesecret terminates cafe.example.com\n   Rules:\n     Host              Path  Backends\n                     \n     cafe.example.com\n                       /tea      teasvc:80 (...)\n                       /coffee   coffeesvc:80 (...)\n\n    Note that the IP address assigned to Ingress must be the same as the IP address assigned to the Ingress controller. This address belongs to the VK Cloud platform's TCP balancer, which routes incoming traffic to the Ingress controller.\n\n5. Check application availability\n\nCheck that pods named tea and coffee exist by getting a list of all pods in the default namespace:\n\n      kubectl get pods\n\nRun the command:\n\n   Coffee\n   Tea\n\n\n      curl k resolve cafe.example.com:443: https://cafe.example.com/coffee\n\n   The request should be answered by one of the two coffee pods. The response will contain the name of the pod that responded (Server name), for example:\n\n      Server address: ...:8080\n   Server name: coffee7c86d7d67czsmwz\n   Date: ...\n   URI: /coffee\n   Request ID: ...\n\n   Receiving such responses means that the Ingress controller is configured correctly:\n\n   interacts with VK Cloud TCP load balancer;\n   terminates SSL\\TLS sessions;\n   provides access to services corresponding to the deployed applications.\n\n\n      curl k resolve cafe.example.com:443: https://cafe.example.com/tea\n\n   The request should be answered by one of the three tea pods. The response will contain the name of the pod that responded (Server name), for example:\n\n      Server address: ...:8080\n   Server name: tea5c457db9gjkgk\n   Date: ...\n   URI: /tea\n   Request ID: ...\n\n   Receiving such responses means that the Ingress controller is configured correctly:\n\n   interacts with VK Cloud TCP load balancer;\n   terminates SSL\\TLS sessions;\n   provides access to services corresponding to the deployed applications.\n\n\nDelete unused resources\n\nIf the Kubernetes resources you created are no longer needed, delete them.\n\n\n   The TCP load balancer created for the Ingress controller will also be removed.\n\n   Linux/macOS\n   Windows\n\n\n      kubectl delete f ./cafeingress.yaml\n   kubectl delete f ./cafesecret.yaml\n   kubectl delete f ./cafe.yaml\n   helm uninstall nginxingresstcp n examplenginxingresstcp\n   kubectl delete namespace examplenginxingresstcp\n\n\n      kubectl delete f ./cafeingress.yaml; `\n   kubectl delete f ./cafesecret.yaml; `\n   kubectl delete f ./cafe.yaml; `\n   helm uninstall nginxingresstcp n examplenginxingresstcp; `\n   kubectl delete namespace examplenginxingresstcp\n\n\nA running cluster consumes computing resources. If you no longer need it:\n\n   stop it to use it later;\n   delete it permanently.\n","url":"/en/kubernetes/k8s/how-to-guides/ingress/ingress-tcp","categoryPartialPath":"/en/kubernetes","description":"Demonstration of Ingress controller interaction with VK Cloud platform TCP load balancer.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Kubernetes","link":"/en/kubernetes","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Containers","link":"/en/kubernetes/k8s","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"10731d23-74b9-494b-b9e1-339beb4c550c","title":"Deploying Ingress controller with HTTP load balancer","data":"The Ingress controller can be deployed in conjunction with the HTTP load balancer of the VK Cloud platform.

Each application consists of a ReplicaSet, a Deployment and a Service corresponding to that Deployment.\n\nTo deploy the demo applications:\n\nDownload the cafe.yaml manifest.\n\nApply this manifest to the cluster:\n\n      kubectl apply f ./cafe.yaml\n\nTo check the status of the application components, run the command:\n\nkubectl get svc,rs,deployment n default\n\nThe output of the command should be similar to this one:\n\nNAME                 TYPE        CLUSTERIP       EXTERNALIP   PORT(S)   AGE\nservice/coffeesvc   ClusterIP   ...                      80/TCP    ...\nservice/teasvc      ClusterIP   ...                      80/TCP    ...\n\nNAME                                DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE\nreplicaset.apps/coffee7c86d7d67c   2         2         2       ...\nreplicaset.apps/tea5c457db9        3         3         3       ...\n\nNAME                     READY   UPTODATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\ndeployment.apps/coffee   2/2     2            2           ...\ndeployment.apps/tea      3/3     3            3           ...\n\n3. Install the Ingress Controller\n\nAdd the NGINX Helm repository:\n\n   Linux/macOS\n   Windows\n\n\n      helm repo add nginxstable https://helm.nginx.com/stable\n   helm repo update\n\n\n      helm repo add nginxstable https://helm.nginx.com/stable; `\n   helm repo update\n\n\nInstall the Ingress controller with the NodePort service by running the command:\n\n   Linux/macOS\n   Windows\n\n\n      helm install nginxingresshttp nginxstable/nginxingress \\\n    createnamespace namespace examplenginxingresshttp \\\n    set controller.service.typeNodePort \\\n    set controller.service.httpsPort.enablefalse \\\n    set controller.service.externalTrafficPolicyLocal\n\n\n      helm install nginxingresshttp nginxstable/nginxingress `\n    createnamespace namespace examplenginxingresshttp `\n    set controller.service.typeNodePort `\n    set controller.service.httpsPort.enablefalse `\n    set controller.service.externalTrafficPolicyLocal\n\n\nWait until the installation of the IngressController is completed and the port is assigned to the controller.\n\n   To check the status of the Ingress Controller, run the command:\n\n      kubectl get svc n examplenginxingresshttp\n\n   The output of the command should be similar to this one:\n\n      NAME                               TYPE       CLUSTERIP     EXTERNALIP   PORT(S)                     AGE\n   nginxingresshttpnginxingress   NodePort   ...                    80:/TCP   ...\n\n4. Create HTTP load balancer\n\nThe HTTP load balancer will terminate SSL/TLS connections and redirect HTTP traffic to the Ingress controller.\n\nTo configure the load balancer:\n\nGather the necessary data:\n\n   The names of the network and subnet where the cluster nodes reside.\n   Names of Cloud Servers service instances that correspond to cluster's master nodes and worker nodes.\n   The port number that was assigned to the Ingress controller in the previous step.\n\nCreate a balancer:\n\n   Go to management console VK Cloud.\n   Select the project where the required cluster is located.\n   Go to Virtual networks → Load balancers.\n   Click the Add button.\n   In the window that appears:\n      Set Loadbalancer name (any).\n      Select the network and subnet that match that of the cluster.\n      Set the DNSname (any).\n      Make sure the Assign external IP option is enabled.\n      Set the processing parameters for each type of traffic:\n\n         For HTTP traffic\n         For HTTPS traffic\n\n\n         In the Balancer rules block, click the + Add rule link.\n         Select Assignment protocol HTTP, set for it the port that was assigned to the Ingress controller.\n         In the Allowed CIDRs block, click the link + Add address. Enter 0.0.0.0.0/0.\n         Select the Send XForwardedFor header option.\n         In the Apply to the following instances block, add all Cloud Servers service instances that correspond to the cluster master nodes and worker nodes.\n\n            Set the same weights for all instances equal to 1.\n\n         Click the Next step button.\n         Click the Add button.\n\n\n         In the Balancer rules block, click the + Add rule link.\n         Select Balancing protocol HTTPS.\n         Select Assignment protocol HTTP, set for it the port that has been assigned to the Ingress controller.\n         In the Allowed CIDRs block, click the link + Add address.

Create an Ingress resource\n\nThe Ingress resource will publish the coffeesvc and teasvc services on the cafe.example.com domain through the Ingress controller, thus providing access to the applications.\n\nThe following will demonstrate how to create an Ingress resource that works exclusively with HTTP traffic that comes from the HTTP balancer configured earlier:\n\nCreate a cafeingress.yaml manifest file with the following contents:\n\n   cafeingress.yaml\n\n      apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\n   kind: Ingress\n   metadata:\n     name: cafeingress\n   spec:\n     ingressClassName: nginx\n     rules:\n     host: cafe.example.com\n       http:\n         paths:\n         path: /tea\n           pathType: Prefix\n           backend:\n             service:\n               name: teasvc\n               port:\n                 number: 80\n         path: /coffee\n           pathType: Prefix\n           backend:\n             service:\n               name: coffeesvc\n               port:\n                 number: 80\n\n\nApply this manifest to the cluster:\n\n      kubectl apply f ./cafeingress.yaml\n\n   Будет создан ресурс Ingress cafeingress.\n\nVerify that the resource was created successfully by running the command:\n\n      kubectl describe ingress cafeingress\n\n   The output of the command should be similar to this one:\n\n      Name:             cafeingresshttp\n   Labels:\n   Namespace:        default\n   Address:\n   Ingress Class:    nginx\n   Default backend:\n   Rules:\n     Host              Path  Backends\n                     \n     cafe.example.com\n                       /tea      teasvc:80 (10.100.54.15:8080,10.100.54.16:8080,10.100.54.17:8080)\n                       /coffee   coffeesvc:80 (10.100.54.13:8080,10.100.54.14:8080)\n\n6. Check application availability\n\nCheck that pods named tea and coffee exist by getting a list of all pods in the default namespace:\n\n      kubectl get pods\n\nRun the command:\n\n   Coffee\n   Tea\n\n\n      curl k resolve cafe.example.com:443: https://cafe.example.com/coffee\n\n   The request should be answered by one of the two coffee pods. The response will contain the name of the pod that responded (Server name), for example:\n\n      Server address: ...:8080\n   Server name: coffee7c86d7d67czsmwz\n   Date: ...\n   URI: /coffee\n   Request ID: ...\n\n   Receiving such responses means that the Ingress controller is configured correctly:\n\n   interacts with VK Cloud HTTP load balancer (which terminates SSL\\TLS sessions);\n   provides access to services corresponding to the deployed applications.\n\n\n      curl k resolve cafe.example.com:443: https://cafe.example.com/tea\n\n   The request should be answered by one of the three tea pods. The response will contain the name of the pod that responded (Server name), for example:\n\n      Server address: ...:8080\n   Server name: tea5c457db9gjkgk\n   Date: ...\n   URI: /tea\n   Request ID: ...\n\n   Receiving such responses means that the Ingress controller is configured correctly:\n\n   interacts with VK Cloud HTTP load balancer (which terminates SSL\\TLS sessions);\n   provides access to services corresponding to the deployed applications.\n\n\nDelete unused resources\n\nIf the Kubernetes resources you created are no longer needed, delete them.\n\n\n   The HTTP load balancer created for the Ingress controller will not be removed. If necessary, remove it manually from the VK Cloud management console interface.\n\n   Linux/macOS\n   Windows\n\n\n      kubectl delete f ./cafeingress.yaml\n   kubectl delete f ./cafe.yaml\n   helm uninstall nginxingresshttp n examplenginxingresshttp\n   kubectl delete namespace examplenginxingresshttp\n\n\n      kubectl delete f ./cafeingress.yaml; `\n   kubectl delete f ./cafe.yaml; `\n   helm uninstall nginxingresshttp n examplenginxingresshttp; `\n   kubectl delete namespace examplenginxingresshttp\n\n\nA running cluster consumes computing resources.

This is necessary to be able to schedule all the required objects.\n\n    For example, you can create one group of nodes with virtual machine type STD328.\n\n   Other cluster parameters are at your discretion.\n\nMake sure that the NGINX Ingress addon (ingressnginx) is installed in a cluster with default parameters. It will be required to provide access to demo applications.\n\n\n    When installing the addon, a standard load balancer will be created.\n\n    Usage of this load balancer is charged.\n\n\nMake sure that you can connect to the cluster using kubectl.\n\nInstall curl if the utility is not already installed.\n\n2. Create demo applications and connect persistent volumes to them\n\nThe following will demonstrate how to create several NGINXbased web applications to display web pages written to the persistent volumes connected to those applications.\nThe NGINX nginxdemos/nginxhello image is used, which displays web pages from the /usr/share/nginx/html directory, so all persistent volumes will be mounted in the application pods via this path.\n\nYou can create one or more demo applications, depending on which way you want to connect the persistent volumes.\n\nConnecting block storages\n\nBlock stores are connected to the cluster with Cinder CSI.\n\nWhen using this type of storage:\n\nonly one pod can access storage (multiple pods cannot use block storage at the same time);\nas a consequence, the ReadWriteOnce mode must be used to access the storage.\n\n\n\nConnecting via static PVC\nConnecting via dynamic PVC\nConnecting to several pods via dynamic PVC\n\n\n\nThis example will create:\n\nDisk in the cloud compute service of the VK Cloud platform.\nA persistent volume corresponding to this disk.\nStatic PVC, using a persistent volume that has already been created.\nApplication tea as a single pod deployment, and its corresponding service.\n\n   For this application there will also be an initialization container (initContainer) which will write the web page to the persistent volume.\n\nTo connect a persistent volume using static PVC:\n\nCreate a network HDD.\n\n   When creating, specify:\n\n   Disk name: any name, such as disktea.\n   Source: empty disk.\n   Disk type: network HDD (cephhdd).\n   Availability zone: MS1.\n   Size: 1 GB.\n\n   Leave other options and settings unchanged.\n\nCopy the ID of the created disk, for example f6d8bf3baaaabbbbcccc4ece8e353246.\n\nExamine the connection features:\n\n   The storage sizes specified in the parameters spec.capacity.storage for the PersistentVolume resource and spec.resources.requests.storage for the PersistentVolumeClaim resource must match the size of the corresponding disk. In this example it is 1 GB.\n   For the PersistentVolumeClaim resource, use an empty value in the storageClassName storage class parameter.\n   The storage access mode is specified in the spec.accessModes parameter for the PersistentVolume resource.\n   The availability zones of the disk and the worker node on which the pod (application) will be located must match. Otherwise an attempt to mount a persistent volume corresponding to the disk on this node will fail. In this example, the pod will be placed on a group of worker nodes in the MS1 availability zone and use a disk from the same zone.\n   ReclaimPolicy Retain is used for the permanent volume. The Delete policy is not used so that you can monitor the state of the disk manually and not accidentally delete it.\n\nCreate a manifest for the tea application.\n\n    For the PersistentVolume resource, specify the ID of the created disk in the spec.cinder.volumeID parameter.\n\n   tea.yaml\n\n      \n   apiVersion: v1\n   kind: PersistentVolume\n   metadata:\n     name: teapv\n   spec:\n     capacity:\n       storage: 1Gi\n     cinder:\n       volumeID:\n     accessModes:\n       ReadWriteOnce\n     persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain\n\n   \n   apiVersion: v1\n   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim\n   metadata:\n     name: teapvc\n   spec:\n     accessModes:\n       ReadWriteOnce\n     resources:\n       requests:\n         storage: 1Gi\n     volumeName: teapv\n     storageClassName: \"\"\n\n   \n   apiVersion: apps/v1\n   kind: Deployment\n   metadata:\n     name: tea\n   spec:\n     replicas: 1\n     selector:\n       matchLabels:\n         app: tea\n     template:\n       metadata:\n         labels:\n           app: tea\n       spec:\n         volumes:\n           name: teavolume\n             persistentVolumeClaim:\n               claimName: teapvc\n         initContainers:\n           name: writehtmlfornginx\n             image: busybox\n             volumeMounts:\n               name: teavolume\n                 mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html\n             command: \"/bin/sh\", \"c\"\n             args:\n               \n                 'echo \"The tea pod says Hello World to everyone!

Otherwise, an attempt to connect a persistent volume corresponding to the PVC to the pod on that node will fail. In this example, the pod will be placed on a group of worker nodes in the MS1 availability zone and use the csicephhddms1 storage class from the same zone.\n   The storage access mode is set in the spec.accessModes parameter for the PersistentVolumeClaim resource.\n   ReclaimPolicy Delete is used for persistent volume (it follows from selected storage class).

This is also known as NodeLocal DNS. This will improve the stability and performance of the DNS service in the cluster, without changing existing applications.\n\nOverview of the DNS architecture in a cluster\n\nLet some pod initiate a DNS query.\n\nWithout using caching DNS servers, the following will happen:\n\n  the DNS query will be sent to the IP address of the kubedns service of the cluster.\n  This IP address will be translated by kubeproxy into the IP address of the kubedns endpoint using iptables rules. In doing so, iptables will use conntrack to track connections.\n  When a response is received from kubedns, the reverse process will be performed.\n\n  If DNS queries are mostly sent via UDP protocol, then high load on kubedns (for example, if any application is actively sending DNS queries) may lead to issues:\n\n  Race condition for conntrack. This results in significant (up to several times) slowdown of responses to DNS queries.\n  Overflow of service tables for conntrack. Records for UDP are removed from these tables only by timeout (default — 30 seconds). If tables are full, new DNS queries sent via UDP will be dropped.\n\nWhen using caching DNS servers, the following will happen:\n\n  Pods will refer to the local caching DNSserver, which is located on the same node as the pods.\n\n     This will avoid address translation (Dynamic NAT, DNAT), the use of iptables and conntrack. The issues described above will be eliminated.\n\n  The caching DNSserver itself will address to service kubedns using iptables and conntrack, but via TCP protocol.\n\n     In this case load on kubedns is reduced, because it is queried directly by a limited number of DNSservers and not by all services of the cluster that require DNS for their work. Also, when using TCP, the latency associated with UDP packet loss and timeouts is reduced.\n\nSee official Kubernetes documentation for more details.\n\n1. Preparatory steps\n\nCreate a Kubernetes cluster of the most current version.\n\n   Choose the cluster parameters at your own discretion.\n\nMake sure that you can connect to the cluster using kubectl.\n\n2. Deploy a caching DNS server on each node\n\nThe DNS server will be deployed in the following configuration:\n\nDeployment type: DaemonSet so that the server is available on all nodes in the cluster.\nIP addresses that the server listens to:\n  A local 169.254.0.10 IP address on each node. This linklocal address is specifically chosen so that there is no overlap with addresses from other subnets used by the cluster.\n  The IP address of the kubedns service. In Cloud Containers clusters, this is always 10.254.0.10.\n\n  This configuration is used because kubeproxy in Cloud Containers clusters operates in iptables mode.\n\nThe port to which Prometheus will connect to collect metrics: 9153.\nLabel for service selection: kubedns: coredns.\nCluster domain: cluster.local.\n\nSee official Kubernetes documentation for more details about configurations and settings.\n\nTo deploy a DNS server:\n\nCreate a manifest file for NodeLocal DNS:\n\n   nodelocaldns.yaml\n\nCopyright 2018 The Kubernetes Authors.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n\n   apiVersion: v1\n   kind: ServiceAccount\n   metadata:\n     name: nodelocaldns\n     namespace: kubesystem\n     labels:\n       kubernetes.io/clusterservice: \"true\"\n       addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode: Reconcile\n   \n   apiVersion: v1\n   kind: Service\n   metadata:\n     name: kubednsupstream\n     namespace: kubesystem\n     labels:\n       k8sapp: coredns\n       kubernetes.io/clusterservice: \"true\"\n       addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode: Reconcile\n       kubernetes.io/name: \"KubeDNSUpstream\"\n   spec:\n     ports:\n     name: dns\n       port: 53\n       protocol: UDP\n       targetPort: 53\n     name: dnstcp\n       port: 53\n       protocol: TCP\n       targetPort: 53\n     selector:\n       k8sapp: coredns\n   \n   apiVersion: v1\n   kind: ConfigMap\n   metadata:\n     name: nodelocaldns\n     namespace: kubesystem\n     labels:\n       addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode: Reconcile\n   data:\n     Corefile: \n       cluster.local:53 \n           errors\n           cache \n                   success 9984 30\n                   denial 9984 5\n           \n           reload\n           loop\n           bind 169.254.0.10 10.254.0.10\n           forward .

If these resources are configured according to ExternalDNS requirements, they will be accessible by their domain names as soon as they are created.\n\nExternalDNS integrates with the VK Cloud DNS service via a plugin. Below is an example of installing ExternalDNS to a cluster and using this tool with the Ingress and Service resources.\n\nPreparatory steps\n\nCreate a DNS zone for ExternalDNS to work with, if not already done.\n\n   In the example below, the example.com zone is used.\n\nCreate a Cloud Containers cluster of the latest version that has an external IP address and is accessible from the Internet.\n\n   Select other cluster parameters at your discretion.\n\nMake sure that you can connect to the cluster using kubectl.\n\n   To connect, use the cluster configuration file (kubeconfig) downloaded from your VK Cloud management console.\n\nInstall Helm version 3.0.0 or higher if the utility is not already installed.\n\n   To install, select a version of Helm that is compatible with the cluster.\n\nSet an environment variable that points to kubeconfig for the cluster. This will make it easier to work with the kubectl and helm utilities when installing ExternalDNS.\n\n   The path to your kubeconfig file may differ from the example below.\n\n   Linux (bash)/macOS (zsh)\n   Windows (PowerShell)\n\n\n      export KUBECONFIG\"/home/user/.kube/kubernetescluster1234_kubeconfig.yaml\"\n\n\n      $Env:KUBECONFIG\"C:\\Users\\user\\.kube\\kubernetescluster1234_kubeconfig.yaml\"\n\n\n1. Prepare a user for ExternalDNS\n\nExternalDNS will use this VK Cloud user's credentials to cooperate with the VK Cloud API and manage DNS resource records.\n\nPrepare the user and get all the necessary credentials:\n\nSelect an existing user or invite a new user to the project.\n\n   User Requirements:\n\n   API access must be enabled.\n   One of the following roles must be assigned in order for ExternalDNS to operate resource records within the DNS zone:\n\n     Network Administrator (a minimum required role).\n     Project Administrator.\n     Superadministrator.\n     Project Owner.\n\n\n     To work with ExternalDNS, it is recommended to assign a dedicated user with the Network administrator role. This will minimize possible damage if an attacker gains access to this user's credentials.\n\n\nGet the credentials you need to access the VK Cloud API:\n\n   Go to your VK Cloud management console using the credentials of the user assigned to ExternalDNS.\n   Click the username in the page header and select Project Settings.\n   Go to the API access tab and note the values of the following parameters:\n\n      Project ID (Project ID for OpenStack);\n      User Domain Name;\n      Username;\n      Region Name;\n      Auth URL (Authentication URL).\n\nWrite down the password for this user: it is also required to access the API.\n\n2. Install ExternalDNS\n\nCreate a namespace where ExternalDNS will be installed:\n\n      kubectl create ns externaldns\n\nIn this namespace, create a secret that contains the VK Cloud API access credentials obtained during user preparation:\n\n   Linux (bash)/macOS (zsh)\n   Windows (PowerShell)\n\n\n      kubectl n externaldns create secret generic vkcsauth \\\n     fromliteralProjectID\"\" \\\n     fromliteralUserDomainName\"\" \\\n     fromliteralUsername\"\" \\\n     fromliteralRegionName\"\" \\\n     fromliteralAuthURL\"\" \\\n     fromliteralPassword\"\"\n\n\n      kubectl n externaldns create secret generic vkcsauth `\n     fromliteralProjectID\"\" `\n     fromliteralUserDomainName\"\" `\n     fromliteralUsername\"\" `\n     fromliteralRegionName\"\" `\n     fromliteralAuthURL\"\" `\n     fromliteralPassword\"\"\n\n\nAdd the Bitnami Helm repository:\n\n      helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami\n\nCreate a file that contains the values needed to install ExternalDNS with Helm:\n\n   externaldnsvkcsvalues.yaml\n\n      policy: upsertonly\n   txtPrefix: externaldns\n\n   provider: webhook\n\n   extraArgs:\n     webhookproviderurl: http://localhost:8888\n\n   sidecars:\n     name: vkcsplugin\n       image: registry.infra.mail.ru:5010/externaldnsvkcsplugin:latest\n       imagePullPolicy: Always\n       ports:\n         name: http\n           containerPort: 8888\n       livenessProbe:\n         httpGet:\n           path: /healthz\n           port: http\n         initialDelaySeconds: 10\n         timeoutSeconds: 5\n       readinessProbe:\n         httpGet:\n           path: /healthz\n           port: http\n         initialDelaySeconds: 10\n         timeoutSeconds: 5\n       env:\n         name: OS_AUTH_URL\n           valueFrom:\n             secretKeyRef:\n               name: vkcsauth\n               key: AuthURL\n         name: OS_USERNAME\n           valueFrom:\n             secretKeyRef:\n               name: vkcsauth\n               key: Username\n         name: OS_PASSWORD\n           valueFrom:\n             secretKeyRef:\n               name: vkcsauth\n               key: Password\n         name: OS_PROJECT_ID\n           valueFrom:\n             secretKeyRef:\n               name: vkcsauth\n               key: ProjectID\n         name: OS_DOMAIN_NAME\n           valueFrom:\n             secretKeyRef:\n               name: vkcsauth\n               key: UserDomainName\n         name: OS_REGION_NAME\n           valueFrom:\n             secretKeyRef:\n               name: vkcsauth\n               key: RegionName\n         name: SERVER_HOST\n           value: \"0.0.0.0\"\n         name: SERVER_PORT\n           value: \"8888\"\n\n\n   The behavior of the ExternalDNS Helm chart is influenced by many values. The created file contains a minimum set of values that is sufficient to start working with ExternalDNS. The most important values affecting the behavior of ExternalDNS with the VK Cloud DNS are described below. Descriptions of values that do not apply to the VK Cloud plugin (all values except sidecars) are given in README.md for the chart.\n\n\n   Do not change or delete the required values listed below. This may cause ExternalDNS to work incorrectly.\n\n   Description of important values that affect the behavior of ExternalDNS\n\n   (Required value) provider: the webhook value indicates that an external plugin with webhooks support is required to work with DNS.\n\n   (Required value) extraArgs:webhookproviderurl: the URL to be used to interact with the plugin.\n\n   policy: the resource record synchronization policy. The default policy is upsertonly: ExternalDNS will only add resource records, not delete them.\n\n     If you want ExternalDNS to remove resource records when deleting Kubernetes resources for which the records were created, use the sync policy.\n\n   txtPrefix: prefix for TXT records that are created by ExternalDNS.\n\n     ExternalDNS can automatically add both A records and CNAME records for Kubernetes resources.\n\n     ExternalDNS keeps track of which DNS zone resource records it manages by placing service information in TXT records. In particular, with the default settings, it will create a service TXT record with the same name as the record being added: for example, for the A record example.com, a corresponding TXT record with the same name example.com will be created.\n\n     However, according to RFC 1912, CNAME records cannot coexist with other records with the same name. That is why ExternalDNS is configured to prefix the name of TXT records with the value specified in txtPrefix. This allows you to avoid possible collisions when working with CNAME records: for example, for the CNAME record example.com a corresponding TXT record with the name externaldnsexample.com will be created.\n\n     You can specify a prefix different from externaldns, if necessary.\n\n\n   The plugin for ExternalDNS, which provides its integration with the VK Cloud DNS, has many settings that affect the plugin's behavior. The settings are set using environment variables in sidecars.env. In the created file, only the required settings are set. If necessary, you can specify additional settings for the plugin by adding the appropriate environment variables.\n\n\n   Do not modify or delete the required plugin settings listed below. This may cause ExternalDNS to work incorrectly.\n\n    Description of values that affect plugin behavior\n\n   (Required settings) The settings corresponding to the variables with the OS_ prefix are used to authenticate the plugin when interacting with the VK Cloud API.\n\n     The values of these variables are stored in the Kubernetes secret that was created earlier.\n\n   (Required settings) The settings corresponding to the SERVER_HOST and SERVER_PORT variables have fixed values and are necessary for the plugin to work correctly.\n\n   DNS zone filtering settings:\n\n     Filters for DNS zones in which resource records are allowed to be created:\n\n       DOMAIN_FILTERS: a string with a list of domain names separated by commas. For example, example.com,contoso.com.\n       REGEX_DOMAIN_FILTER: a string with a regular expression (RE2 syntax). For example, .*.com$.\n\n       If both filters are configured, the REGEX_DOMAIN_FILTER filter takes precedence over DOMAIN_FILTERS. By default, no filtering is performed.\n\n     Filters for DNS zones in which resource records are not allowed to be created:\n\n       EXCLUDE_DOMAINS: a string with a list of domain names separated by commas. For example, example.org,foo.bar.com.\n       REGEX_DOMAIN_FILTER_EXCLUSION: a string with a regular expression (RE2 syntax). For example, ^stage.*.com$.\n\n       If both filters are configured, the REGEX_DOMAIN_FILTER_EXCLUSION filter takes precedence over EXCLUDE_DOMAINS. By default, no filtering is performed.\n\n     SERVER_READ_TIMEOUT: timeout for reading when the connection to the server is open (in seconds). Default value: 30.\n     SERVER_WRITE_TIMEOUT: timeout for writing when the connection to the server is open (in seconds). Default value: 30.\n\n     LOG_LEVEL: level of logging of events that occur during plugin operation.\n\n       The error, warn, info, debug, and trace levels are supported. Default value: info.\n\n     DRY_RUN: flag that allows the plugin to be run in \"dry run\" mode.\n\n       false (default): \"dry run\" mode is disabled. The plugin runs and manipulates resource records in the DNS zone as configured.\n       true: \"dry run\" mode is enabled. The plugin runs but does not manipulate resource records in the DNS zone: no resource records will be created or deleted.\n\n\nInstall ExternalDNS:\n\n      helm n externaldns install externaldnsvkcs bitnami/externaldns f externaldnsvkcsvalues.yaml\n\nVerify that the Helm chart has been successfully deployed:\n\n      helm n externaldns list && kubectl n externaldns get all\n\n   Example of partial output of the command\n\n      NAME                    NAMESPACE       ...        ...

Verify that External DNS is working\n\nNext, several demo applications based on NGINX's Cafe example will be deployed. These applications will be published (made available from the Internet) using Service and Ingress configured to work with ExternalDNS.\n\n3.1. Publish the application using a service like LoadBalancer\n\nCreate a manifest for the tea application:\n\n   teaapp.yaml\n\n      apiVersion: apps/v1\n   kind: Deployment\n   metadata:\n     name: tea\n     labels:\n       app: tea\n   spec:\n     replicas: 3\n     selector:\n       matchLabels:\n         app: tea\n     template:\n       metadata:\n         labels:\n           app: tea\n       spec:\n         containers:\n         name: tea\n           image: nginxdemos/nginxhello:plaintext\n           ports:\n           containerPort: 8080\n\n\nApply this manifest to the cluster to deploy the application:\n\n      kubectl apply f teaapp.yaml\n\nVerify that the application has been successfully deployed as a ReplicaSet of three replicas:\n\n      kubectl get rs,pod l apptea\n\n   Example of partial output of the command\n\n      NAME                           DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE\n   replicaset.apps/teaXXXXXXXXX  3         3         3       ...\n\n   NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\n   pod/teaXXXXXXXXXAAAAA   1/1     Running   0          ...\n   pod/teaXXXXXXXXXBBBBB   1/1     Running   0          ...\n   pod/teaXXXXXXXXXCCCCC   1/1     Running   0          ...\n\n\nCreate a teaservice.yaml manifest for the Kubernetes service (Service).\n\n   This service will be used to publish the deployed application. The application will be accessible by the domain name tea.example.com.\n\n   To have ExternalDNS create resource records for the service:\n\n   The externaldns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname annotation must be set for the service.\n   The service must have the LoadBalancer type.\n\n   Specify the externaldns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl annotation if you want to set a nonstandard TTL for resource records (default: 86400 seconds, 24 hours).\n\n      apiVersion: v1\n   kind: Service\n   metadata:\n     annotations:\n       externaldns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: \"tea.example.com\"\n       externaldns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl: \"3600\"\n     name: teasvc\n     labels:\n       app: tea\n   spec:\n     type: LoadBalancer\n     ports:\n     port: 80\n       targetPort: 8080\n       protocol: TCP\n       name: http\n     selector:\n       app: tea\n\n   Here:\n\n   The required externaldns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname annotation is specified: the domain name to use for the service.\n   The optional externaldns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl annotation is specified: TTL in seconds for the resource record to be created by ExternalDNS.\n\n   The LoadBalancer service type is selected. A standard load balancer will be created for such a service. Since the load balancer is created with a public IP address, the application associated with the service will be accessible from the Internet.\n\n\n     Using the load balancer is charged.\n\n\nApply this manifest to the cluster to create the service:\n\n      kubectl apply f teaservice.yaml\n\nCheck the status of the service:\n\n      kubectl get svc teasvc\n\n   Wait until the service is assigned the public IP address of the load balancer. Creating the load balancer can take a long time.\n\n    Example of partial output of the command\n\n   The balancer creation is in progress:\n\n          NAME      TYPE           CLUSTERIP       EXTERNALIP    PORT(S)        AGE\n     teasvc   LoadBalancer   10.254.170.195         80:32314/TCP   ...\n\n   The balancer has been successfully created:\n\n          NAME      TYPE           CLUSTERIP       EXTERNALIP        PORT(S)        AGE\n     teasvc   LoadBalancer   10.254.170.195   203.0.113.111      80:32314/TCP   ...\n\n\nVerify that ExternalDNS has created the necessary resource records:\n\n   Get a list of resource records for the example.com zone.\n   Find the entries created by ExternalDNS in the list:\n\n      One A record tea.example.com.\n      Two TXT records externaldnstea.example.com and externaldnsatea.example.com.\n\n        These TXT records are service records used by ExternalDNS to track the status of the teasvc A record created for the teasvc service.\n\n\n        Such records are easily distinguished by the externaldns prefix in their name. Their values have the standard structure of the form heritage.../owner.../resource....\n\n        If you specified a different prefix value when installing ExternalDNS, the names of the service TXT records will be different.\n\n\n      If the required resource records are not present, wait a few more minutes. ExternalDNS will start creating resource records after the service has been assigned an IP address. This will take some time.\n\nCheck that the application is accessible by domain name. To do this, go to http://tea.example.com in your browser.\n\n   You should see a page with a response from the application like this:\n\n      Server address: 10.100.184.219:8080\n   Server name: teaXXXXXXXXXAAAAA\n   Date: 09/Feb/2024:10:09:51 +0000\n   URI: /\n   Request ID:\n\n   Successful interaction with the application at this address indicates that ExternalDNS works correctly with a service like LoadBalancer.\n\n3.2. Publish the application using Ingress\n\nInstall the Ingress NGINX addon of the latest version to the cluster.\n\n   Perform a standard installation. Do not change any parameters, only edit the addon configuration code:\n\n   Make sure that the service.beta.kubernetes.io/openstackinternalloadbalancer annotation is set to false:\n\n            controller:\n        ...\n        service:\n          annotations: \"loadbalancer.openstack.org/proxyprotocol\": \"true\", \"service.beta.kubernetes.io/openstackinternalloadbalancer\": \"false\"\n          ...\n\n      This is necessary to create a load balancer with a public IP address for the Ingress controller. Then the application using Ingress will be accessible from the Internet.\n\n   Set the controller.publishService.enabled field to true:\n\n            controller:\n        ...\n        publishService:\n          enabled: true\n          pathOverride: \"\"\n          ...\n\n      This is necessary to assign a public IP address of the Ingress controller to the Ingress resource. This will allow ExternalDNS to create the correct resource records for Ingress.\n\n   Wait for the addon installation to complete. This process may take a long time.\n\nCreate a manifest for the coffee application:\n\n   coffeeapp.yaml\n\n      apiVersion: apps/v1\n   kind: Deployment\n   metadata:\n     name: coffee\n     labels:\n       app: coffee\n   spec:\n     replicas: 2\n     selector:\n       matchLabels:\n         app: coffee\n     template:\n       metadata:\n         labels:\n           app: coffee\n       spec:\n         containers:\n         name: coffee\n           image: nginxdemos/nginxhello:plaintext\n           ports:\n           containerPort: 8080\n\n\nCreate a manifest for the Kubernetes service that the application will use.\n\n   coffeeservice.yaml\n\n      apiVersion: v1\n   kind: Service\n   metadata:\n     name: coffeesvc\n     labels:\n      app: coffee\n   spec:\n     type: ClusterIP\n     ports:\n     port: 80\n       targetPort: 8080\n       protocol: TCP\n       name: http\n     selector:\n       app: coffee\n\n\n   Here, the service type is set to ClusterIP, which is sufficient since the application will be published using Ingress. Such a service is accessible only from within the cluster and does not have a dedicated load balancer, unlike the service created earlier.\n\nApply these manifests to the cluster to create all necessary resources:\n\n      kubectl apply f coffeeapp.yaml f coffeeservice.yaml\n\nCheck that the application has been successfully deployed as a ReplicaSet of two replicas along with the corresponding service:\n\n      kubectl get rs,pod,svc l appcoffee\n\n   Example of partial output of the command\n\n      NAME                                DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE\n   replicaset.apps/coffeeYYYYYYYYY    2         2         2       ...\n\n   NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\n   pod/coffeeYYYYYYYYYDDDDD   1/1     Running   0          ...\n   pod/coffeeYYYYYYYYYEEEEE   1/1     Running   0          ...\n\n   NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTERIP      EXTERNALIP   PORT(S)   AGE\n   service/coffeesvc   ClusterIP   10.254.243.13           80/TCP    ...\n\n\nCreate the cafeingress.yaml manifest for the Ingress resource.\n\n   This Ingress resource will be used to publish the deployed application. The application will be available on the cafe.example.com domain at the http://cafe.example.com/coffee URL.\n\n   For ExternalDNS to create resource records for the service, no additional values need to be specified in the manifest: having an Ingress controller configured in the right way is sufficient. The domain name values will be taken from the host fields for the Ingress spec.rules rules.\n\n   Specify the externaldns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl annotation if you want to set a nonstandard TTL for resource records (default: 86400 seconds, 24 hours).\n\n      apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\n   kind: Ingress\n   metadata:\n     name: cafeingress\n     annotations:\n       externaldns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl: \"3600\"\n   spec:\n     ingressClassName: nginx\n     rules:\n     host: cafe.example.com\n       http:\n         paths:\n         path: /coffee\n           pathType: Prefix\n           backend:\n             service:\n               name: coffeesvc\n               port:\n                 number: 80\n\n   Here:\n\n   The optional externaldns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl annotation is specified: TTL in seconds for the resource records to be created by ExternalDNS.\n   The cafe.example.com host for the Ingress rule is specified. Since only one host is specified, one resource record will be created for this domain name.\n   According to the Ingress rule, the coffee application that is behind the coffeesvc service will be accessible at the URL http://cafe.example.com/coffee.\n\nApply this manifest to the cluster to create the resource:\n\n      kubectl apply f cafeingress.yaml\n\nCheck the status of Ingress:\n\n      kubectl get ingress cafeingress\n\n   Wait for the Ingress resource to be assigned a public IP address.

ExternalDNS will begin creating resource records after the Ingress resource has been assigned an IP address. This will take some time.\n\nVerify that the application is accessible by domain name. To do this, go to http://cafe.example.com/coffee in your browser.\n\n   A page should open with a response from the application like:\n\n      Server address: 10.100.184.220:8080\n   Server name: coffeeYYYYYYYYYDDDDD\n   Date: 09/Feb/2024:13:07:11 +0000\n   URI: /coffee\n   Request ID:\n\n   Successful interaction with the application at this address indicates that ExternalDNS works correctly with the Ingress resource.\n\nRemove unused resources\n\nIf you no longer need the Kubernetes resources created for ExternalDNS validation, delete them:\n\n   Delete all resources associated with the tea application:\n\n            kubectl delete f cafeingress.yaml f coffeeservice.yaml f coffeeapp.yaml\n\n      It can take a long time to remove the load balancer associated with the service.\n\n   Remove all resources associated with the coffee application:\n\n            kubectl delete f teaservice.yaml f teaapp.yaml\n\n   Delete the Ingress NGINX addon.\n\n      It may take a long time to remove the addon and its associated resources.\n\n   Delete the resource records created by ExternalDNS.\n\n      This must be done if you did not modify the externaldnsvkcsvalues.yaml file when installing ExternalDNS: in this case ExternalDNS uses the upsertonly policy and does not remove resource records from the DNS zone when removing Kubernetes resources. If you modified this file and selected the sync policy, then these records will be deleted automatically.\n\n      List of resource records:\n\n      A record tea.example.com.\n      TXT records externaldnstea.example.com and externaldnsatea.example.com.\n      CNAME record cafe.example.com.\n      TXT records externaldnscafe.example.com and externaldnscnamecafe.example.com.\n\nIf you no longer need ExternalDNS, delete it:\n\n   Remove the Helm chart from ExternalDNS:\n\n            helm n externaldns uninstall externaldnsvkcs\n\n   Remove the externaldns namespace.\n\n\n      The vkcsauth secret, which contains the credentials to access the VK Cloud API, will also be removed.\n\n\n            kubectl delete ns externaldns\n\nA running Cloud Containers cluster consumes compute resources and is charged.

Update of this addon using VK Cloud interfaces is not available, but you can update the addon manually.\n\nTo upgrade the Kube Prometheus Stack addon from version 36.2.0 to version 54.2.2, it is necessary to uninstall the current version of the addon and then install the new one. Therefore, the upgrade process includes preparing the environment of the current version of the addon for saving and further reusing it with the new version.\n\n\n\nIt is further assumed that the addon is installed in the namespace (e.g., kubeprometheusstack) that contains only those Kubernetes resources that relate to the addon.\n\nIf there are other Kubernetes resources in the namespace, modify the commands and script so that they do not affect resources not related to the addon.\n\nPreparation steps\n\nIf you already have an existing Cloud Containers cluster with the Kube Prometheus Stack addon that needs to be upgraded, skip this step.\n\n   Otherwise, create a test cluster where the addon update will be performed:\n\n   Create a Cloud Containers cluster version 1.26.5.\n\n      When you create the cluster, select the Assign external IP option. Other cluster parameters can be set at your discretion.\n\n   Install the Kube Prometheus Stack addon version 36.2.0 in the cluster.\n\n      Perform a quick installation of the addon (without editing the addon configuration code).\n\nVerify that you can connect to the cluster via kubectl.\n\n   To connect, use the cluster configuration file (kubeconfig) downloaded from the VK Cloud management console.\n\nMake sure the addon is available and working. To do this, access the Grafana web interface.\n\n\n   Write down the password to access Grafana, even if it is stored as a Kubernetes secret. During the addon upgrade process, the namespace where the addon and the secret are located will be deleted along with all contents.\n\n\nInstall Helm version 3.0.0 or higher if the utility has not been already installed.\n\n   To install, select the Helm version that is compatible with the cluster.\n\nSet an environment variable pointing to kubeconfig for the cluster. This will simplify your work with kubectl and helm when updating the addon.\n\n   The path to your kubeconfig files may differ from the example below.\n\n   Linux (bash)/macOS (zsh)\n   Windows (PowerShell)\n\n\n      export KUBECONFIG\"/home/user/.kube/kubernetescluster1234_kubeconfig.yaml\"\n\n\n      $Env:KUBECONFIG\"C:\\Users\\user\\.kube\\kubernetescluster1234_kubeconfig.yaml\"\n\n\nheading(1.

Prepare addon environment for update)id2_prepare_addon_environment_for_update\n\nVolumes for the addon are created by default using the Retain reclaim policy if no changes related to the storage class have been made to the addon configuration code. So, deleting the addon will cause the deletion of the persistent volumes of data as well. This will result in the loss of metrics accumulated during the addon operation, as well as other data necessary for the addon to work.\n\nIn addition, the following Kubernetes resources, which are also used by the addon, may prevent you from installing a new version of the addon:\n\nA set of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) required for the addon to work.\nA set of Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) that allows the addon to use persistent volumes.\n\nBefore you update the addon, protect the persistent volumes used by this addon from deletion, and remove the mentioned Kubernetes resources using one of the methods below.\n\n\n\nReadytouse bash script for Linux\nSeparate commands for Linux/macOS/Windows\n\n\n\nCreate a file with the script code:\n\n   prepareforaddonupdate.sh\n\n      #!/bin/sh\n\n   set e\n\n   DEFAULT_NAMESPACEprometheusmonitoring\n   : \"$NAMESPACE:prometheusmonitoring\"\n   : \"$CHART_NAME:kubeprometheusstack\"\n   : \"$DRY_RUN:none\"\n\n   usage() \n   cat /dev/null 2>&1; then\n           helm uninstall \"$@\" \"$CHART_NAME\" wait timeout 600s \"$dry_run\" >/dev/null 2>&1  true\n       fi\n       helm list \"$@\" aA f \"$CHART_NAME\" q\n   \n\n   delete_prometheus_namespace() \n       if kubectl get \"$@\" ns \"$NAMESPACE\" >/dev/null 2>&1; then\n           kubectl delete \"$@\" ns \"$NAMESPACE\" dryrun\"$DRY_RUN\" wait timeout 600s force graceperiod0 cascadeforeground\n       fi\n   \n\n   echo \"Setting retain policy for the Prometheus PVs...\"\n   set_prometheus_pv_retain_reclaim_policy \"$@\"\n   echo \"Deleting Prometheus chart...\"\n   delete_prometheus_chart \"$@\"\n   echo \"Deleting Prometheus PVCs...\"\n   delete_prometheus_pvc \"$@\"\n   echo \"Clearing Prometheus PV claim references...\"\n   clear_prometheus_pv_claim_reference \"$@\"\n   echo \"Clearing Prometheus CRDs...\"\n   delete_prometheus_crd \"$@\"\n    \"$NAMESPACE\"  \"$DEFAULT_NAMESPACE\"  && \n       echo \"Deleting Prometheus namespace...\"\n       delete_prometheus_namespace \"$@\"\n   \n   echo \"Completed!\"\n\n\n   The script performs the following actions:\n\n   Detects persistent volumes that are associated with PVCs created in the namespace in which the addon is installed. For these persistent volumes, the script defines the Retain reclaim policy. This is necessary to prevent these volumes from being deleted when the current version of the addon is uninstalled.\n   Deletes the Helm chart of the current version of the addon. This is necessary for successfully removing the PVCs and CRDs sets that are used by the addon.\n   Removes a set of PVCs from the namespace where the addon has been installed. This is necessary for unbinding PVs from PVCs and then reusing these PVs with a new version of the addon.\n   Removes references to the deleted PVCs from persistent volumes that have been linked to these PVCs. These persistent volumes will become available for linking (PVs status becomes Available) and will be reused by the new version of the addon after it is installed.\n   Deletes the set of CRDs that have been used by the addon.\n   Deletes the prometheusmonitoring namespace if the script has been run for this namespace.\n\nMake the script code file executable:\n\n      chmod +x prepareforaddonupdate.sh\n\nDefine the parameters to run the script with:\n\n      bash prepareforaddonupdate.sh h\n\n   Help will be displayed, showing the available parameters and their default values:\n\n   h: show the help.\n   k: path to the kubeconfig file.

Find code fragments that are responsible for setting up the storage for the following addon components:\n\n      Grafana\n      Alert Manager\n      Prometheus\n\n\n            grafana:\n\n        ...\n\n        persistence:\n          enabled: true\n          storageClassName: \"csicephhddgz1\"\n          accessModes:\n          ReadWriteOnce\n          size: 1Gi\n\n        ...\n\n\n            alertmanager:\n\n        ...\n\n        alertmanagerSpec:\n\n        ...\n\n          storage:\n            volumeClaimTemplate:\n              spec:\n                storageClassName: \"csicephhddgz1\"\n                accessModes:\n                ReadWriteOnce\n                resources:\n                  requests:\n                    storage: 1Gi\n\n\n            prometheus:\n\n        ...\n\n        prometheusSpec:\n\n          ...\n\n          storageSpec:\n            volumeClaimTemplate:\n              spec:\n                storageClassName: \"csicephssdgz1\"\n                accessModes:\n                ReadWriteOnce\n                resources:\n                  requests:\n                    storage: 10Gi\n\n\n   Review the configuration code for the new version of the addon that you plan to install.\n\n      If the code fragments that are responsible for setting up the storage are different from those obtained earlier, correct them. The storage settings for Grafana, Alert Manager and Prometheus should exactly match the same settings used for the previous version of the addon.\n\n   (Optional) Make other changes to the addon configuration code.\n\n      If you specified the password for access to Grafana in the grafana.adminPassword field when installing the previous version of the addon, you do not need to specify it again. The new version of the addon will use the previous PVs as a storage, so the password will remain the same. Installing a new version of the addon will not change the password for accessing Grafana, even if you leave this field empty: a secret with the password for Grafana will be generated, but it will not be used.\n\n\n      Incorrectly specified configuration code may cause errors during installation or inoperability of the addon.\n\n\n   Install the addon.\n\n      The installation process may take a long time. Wait until it is completed.\n\nGet information about the Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) and persistent volumes (PVs) used by the addon:\n\n      kubectl n $NAMESPACE get pvc\n\n   The output of the command should be similar to the output of the previously executed command for the addon of the previous version. Thus, the alertmanager... PVC must be associated with the same PV that Alert Manager used earlier. Similarly for Prometheus and Grafana.\n\nheading(4.

Gatekeeper checks all CRD operations for Kubernetes resources (creation, modification, deletion) for compliance with the specified constraints and decides whether to deny or allow a particular action.\n\nThe Open Policy Agent (OPA) is responsible for applying constraints (in the form of policies).\n\nHow Gatekeeper works\n\nCompliance with policies is controlled via constraints. These constraints are created based on constraint templates and define:\n\nScope of the constraint: which Kubernetes resources will be checked for compliance with the rules defined in the constraint template.\nParameters that will be used when checking for compliance with the rules.\n\nThe constraint template, in turn, checks for compliance with the rules described in it with the scope and parameters specified in the constraint. These rules are described directly in the YAML file of the constraint template using Rego language.

These objects list the groups and types of resources to which the constraint will be applied. If several groups and kinds of resources are specified, one match is enough for the resource to fall within the scope of the constraint (a logical OR operation is applied).\n\n  scope: defines whether to check for matches for all resources at once (default), for clusterscoped resources, namespacescoped resources.\n\n  namespaces: a list of namespaces. If this option is given, constraints apply only to resources in the namespaces specified.\n\n    This option may be configured as a prefix to select more than one namespace at a time. For example, namespaces: kube* corresponds to kubesystem and kubepublic.\n\n  excludedNamespaces: a list of namespaces that serve as exceptions for namespaces. If this parameter is set, the constraints apply only to resources that do not belong to these namespaces.\n\n    This option may be configured as a prefix to select multiple namespaces at once. For example, namespaces: kube* corresponds to kubesystem and kubepublic.\n\n  labelSelector: a combination of two optional fields matchLabels and matchExpressions. These two fields provide different methods to select or exclude Kubernetes resources based on the keys and labels values included in the resource's metadata.\n\n    For a resource to be selected, it must satisfy all the requirements specified here (the \"logical AND\" operation is applied).\n\n  namespaceSelector: a label selector for the namespace containing the resource, or the resource itself if it is a namespace.\n\n  name: the name of the resource. If this parameter is given, constraints apply only to resources with the specified name.\n\n    This parameter can be specified as a prefix to select multiple resources at once. For example, name: pod* corresponds to poda and podb.\n\nspec.parameters: parameters that will first be checked in the constraint template for type matching and then substituted in Rego rules.\n\nspec.enforcementAction: action when handling constraint violation. Possible values:\n\n  deny (default): prohibit creation of a Kubernetes resource.\n  warn: create Kubernetes resource and issue a warning.

Data stored on a PV is not lost when an individual container or entire pod fails.\n\nWorkloads cannot use PV directly. A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) should be created, which allows you to request a persistent volume with the required parameters and then use it in workloads. The most common parameters that can be specified in a PVC are:\n\nStorage size (spec.resources.requests.storage).\nVolume access mode (spec.accessModes).\n\n  Kubernetes supports the following volume access modes:\n\n  ReadWriteOnce (RWO): a volume can be mounted in read and write mode by a single node in the cluster. Such a volume can be used by multiple pods at once if they are all hosted on the same node to which the volume is mounted.\n\n  ReadOnlyMany (ROX): a volume can be mounted in readonly mode by multiple nodes in a cluster.\n  ReadWriteMany (RWX): a volume can be mounted in readwrite mode by multiple nodes in the cluster.\n\n  A PVC can be used to request a PV that is capable of multiple modes, but when mounting such a PV, you will have to select one of the modes. For example, if a PV with both RWO and RWX modes is requested using PVC, one of the following actions will be available:\n\n  Either mount this PV in RWO mode by a single cluster node.\n  Or mount this PV in RWX mode by multiple cluster nodes.\n\n\n\nAccess to PVC in RWX mode is not implemented in Cloud Containers. To organize shared access to data from several pods on different nodes, deploy NFS server on a separate virtual machine.\n\nPV and PVC lifecycle\n\nThe PV and PVC life cycle is independent of the pod life cycle and consists of four consecutive stages:\n\nProvisioning.\nBinding.\nUsing.\nReclaiming.\n\n1. Provisioning\n\nA PV must be prepared prior to requesting the PV via PVC. It can be done in one of the following ways:\n\nStatic provisioning: the PV is created manually, e.g. by a Kubernetes administrator.\nDynamic provisioning: the PV is created automatically after the PVC is created.\n\nFor dynamic provisioning, two conditions must be met:\n\nStorage classes must be configured in the Kubernetes cluster. Cloud Containers clusters already contain preconfigured storage classes.\n\nFor PVCs, no suitable PVs shall be found that already exist.\n\nDuring dynamic provisioning Kubernetes will try to create a PV matching the parameters of the PVC. One of the storage classes will be used:\n\nA storage class explicitly defined in the PVC.\nA default storage class if the class is not explicitly specified in the PVC.\n\nIn VK Cloud Kubernetes clusters, the default storage class is not configured. If you do not plan to explicitly set the storage class in the PVC, then manually set the default storage class before creating the PVC.\n\n2. Binding\n\nPV and PVC are bound on a onetoone basis for use in workloads. An already bound PV cannot be used with other PVCs.\n\nWhen a new PVC is created in a Kubernetes cluster:\n\nKubernetes tries to find a suitable PV that is available for binding (in the Available status) and matches the parameters specified in the PVC as closely as possible.\n\n   If there is no available PV that exactly matches the parameters specified in the PVC, a PV with excessive characteristics may be selected. Keep an eye on the available PVs and the PVCs being created to avoid a situation where all PVs of large capacity are associated with PVCs that request small amounts of storage. An extra space on such PVs will be wasted and they will not be available for binding when PVCs requiring large amounts of storage appear in the cluster.\n\n   PV selection example\n\n   For example, let there exist in a cluster:\n\n   A PVC that requests 10Gi of storage in ROX mode.\n   The first PV of 100Gi in ROX, RWX modes.\n   The second PV of 5Gi in ROX mode.\n   The third PV of 100Gi in RWO, ROX, RWX modes.\n\n   In this case, the PVC will be bound to the first PV even though:\n\n   The PV size exceeds the requested size and the PV supports more modes than specified in the PVC.\n   There is the third PV with the same size as the first PV but with excessive set of access modes.\n\n\nKubernetes performs one of the actions:\n\n   If a suitable PV was found, Kubernetes binds it to the PVC.\n   If no suitable PV was found, Kubernetes attempts to dynamically provision a PV, then to bind the created PV to the PVC.\n\nIf no PV is bound to a PVC, then the PVC remains in the Unbound state. Workloads cannot use such PVC as a volume. Kubernetes will periodically try to bind such PVC to new PVs if they appear in the cluster.\n\n3. Using\n\nOnce Kubernetes has bound a PVC to a PV, that PVC can be used by a workload as a normal volume.\n\n4. Reclaiming\n\nWhen a PVC is no longer needed and is deleted, a specified reclaim policy is applied to the PV associated with that PVC.\n\nThe policy is set in one of the following ways:\n\nWhen creating a persistent volume manually.\nWhen setting a default storage class or setting a storage class in the PVC.\n\nAvailable policies:\n\nKeep the volume (Retain).\n\n  Use it for PVs with sensitive data to protect the data if the PVC is accidentally deleted. If necessary, you can manually clean up and delete PVs with this policy.\n\nDelete Volume (Delete).\n\n  Depending on the selected PV type, the underlying storage associated with the PV may also be deleted.\n\n\n  Use this policy and the storage classes that implement it with caution: data loss is possible.\n  In VK Cloud, due to integration with Cinder CSI, deleting a PV will also delete the VK Cloud disk associated with it.\n\n\nIn VK Cloud Kubernetes clusters, the storage type selected affects available reclaim policies.\n\nSee also\n\nHow storage is organized in Cloud Containers.\nList of preconfigured storage classes.\nUsecase that demonstrates using of various PVCs.\nOfficial Kubernetes documentation for more information about PVCs and PVs.\n","url":"/en/kubernetes/k8s/reference/pvs-and-pvcs","categoryPartialPath":"/en/kubernetes","description":"General information about working with Persistent Volumes with use of Persistent Volume Claim.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Kubernetes","link":"/en/kubernetes","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Containers","link":"/en/kubernetes/k8s","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"c71512d8-cb6b-4543-9588-49af1302a9ca","title":"About service","data":"To solve the problems of stream processing of large amounts of data, Cloud Big Data services allow you to create Cloud Streams clusters that provide the ability to safely and efficiently manage streams in real time.\n\nCloud Streams is a faulttolerant and scalable streaming data processing system built on Apache Kafka and Apache NiFi.

Prepare to work with a Cloud Kafka instance\n\nGet access to Kafka console clients on the host from which you plan to work with the service instance:\n\n   Linux (bash) / macOS (zsh)\n\n\n   Make sure that Java version 11 or higher is installed on the host:\n\n            java version\n\n      If the output contains Command 'java'not found or the version is outdated, install the Java Development Kit (JDK), for example, OpenJDK. You can install both the entire JDK and only the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).\n\n     Example of installing OpenJDK 11 (JRE only) using apt for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS:\n\n            sudo apt update && sudo apt install openjdk11jre\n\n   Download the archive with the Kafka distribution version 3.5.0. The Kafka versions for the service instance and on the host must match.

Send a message to the topic and receive it\n\n\n\nLinux (bash) / macOS (zsh)\n\n\n\nCreate a separate terminal session in which the console client will work.\nRun the clientconsumer in this session and specify the test topic as the source. The clientconsumer will connect to the Cloud Kafka instance using the previously received bootstrap server address and configuration file, and continuously read and output messages from the topic. A new topic will be created automatically the first time you access it.\n\n   To do this, run the command:\n\n      bin/kafkaconsoleconsumer.sh \\\n     bootstrapserver kafkabootstrap.example.com:9093 \\\n     consumer.config clientssl.properties \\\n     topic test\n\nCreate another terminal session in which another console client will be running.\nRun the clientproducer in this session and specify the test topic as the receiver. The clientproducer will connect to the Cloud Kafka instance using the previously received bootstrap server address and configuration file, and send the input messages to the topic.\n\n   To do this, run the command:\n\n      bin/kafkaconsoleproducer.sh \\\n     brokerlist kafkabootstrap.example.com:9093 \\\n     producer.config clientssl.properties\n     topic test\n\nIn the terminal session with the manufacturer client, enter a test message and then press Enter:\n\n      This is the test message.\n\nCheck that the sent test message is displayed in the terminal session with the consumer client:\n\n      This is the test message.\n\n   The message means that the Cloud Kafka instance works correctly.\n\nShut down the clients by pressing the keyboard shortcut CTRL+C in both terminal sessions.\n\nDelete unused resources\n\nThe instance of Cloud Kafka is charged and consumes computing resources. If you don't need it anymore, delete it.\n\nYou can also delete the configuration file clientssl.properties and the downloaded Kafka distribution.\n","url":"/en/data-processing/kafka/quick-start","categoryPartialPath":"/en/data-processing","description":"How to get started with the Cloud Kafka service in the VK Cloud project.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Data processing and analysis","link":"/en/data-processing","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Kafka","link":"/en/data-processing/kafka","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"1d4b25a0-8344-42e2-9d40-50b52363da87","title":"About the service","data":"Cloud Kafka is a distributed platform for transferring messages between applications.

Use environment variables, vaults for secrets, or other tools to work with sensitive data.\n\n\nCreate a Cloud Spark cluster.\n\n   Select the cluster parameters at your discretion.\n\nRun the script to get information about Spark clusters in the project:\n\n      from mlplatform_client import MLPlatform\n\n   REFRESH_TOKEN  ''\n\n   mlp  MLPlatform(REFRESH_TOKEN)\n   print(mlp.get_clusters())\n\n   Details about the clusters will be displayed.\n\nFind and write down the ID of the created cluster (contained in the id field).\n\nCreate a ClickHouse instance that:\n\n   uses the newest version available;\n   uses the Single configuration;\n   has an external IP address and is accessible from the Internet;\n   has a configured user user_spark;\n   is configured to work with the new db_spark database.\n\n   Make a note of the user password, you will need it later.\n\nFind out the IP address assigned to the created ClickHouse instance:\n\n   Go to your VK Cloud account.\n   Select the project where the database instance is located.\n   Go to Databases → Database instances.\n   Click the name of the instance and then click the Information tab.\n   Make a note of the external IP address of the instance.\n\n1. Create a file with the Spark application code\n\nCreate a queryclickhouse.py file with the following contents:\n\nimport os\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nCLICKHOUSE_IP  os.environ.get('CH_IP')\nCLICKHOUSE_PORT  8123\nCLICKHOUSE_DB  'db_spark'\nCLICKHOUSE_USER  os.environ.get('CH_USER')\nCLICKHOUSE_USER_PASSWORD  os.environ.get('CH_PASSWORD')\nCLICKHOUSE_JDBC_DRIVER  os.environ.get('CH_DRIVER_JAR')\n\nspark  SparkSession \\\n    .builder \\\n    .appName('PythonSparkClickHouse') \\\n    .config('spark.driver.extraClassPath', f'./CLICKHOUSE_JDBC_DRIVER') \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n\nprint(\"Reading ClickHouse table\")\n\ndata_frame  spark.read.format('jdbc') \\\n    .option('url', f'jdbc:clickhouse://CLICKHOUSE_IP:CLICKHOUSE_PORT/CLICKHOUSE_DB') \\\n    .option('user', CLICKHOUSE_USER) \\\n    .option('password', CLICKHOUSE_USER_PASSWORD) \\\n    .option('query', 'SELECT * FROM system.build_options') \\\n    .option('driver', 'com.clickhouse.jdbc.ClickHouseDriver') \\\n    .load()\n\ndata_frame.show();\nprint(\"Finished reading ClickHouse table\")\n\nspark.stop()\n\nThis is the code for a Spark application that connects to a ClickHouse instance and fetches ClickHouse build information using an SQL query.\n\nTo simplify the use of this application, some connection parameters are set using environment variables:\n\nThe connection to ClickHouse is made to the CH_IP IP address using a driver that is stored in the CH_DRIVER_JAR JAR file. The driver file will be uploaded later.\nAuthentication in ClickHouse is performed using the CH_USER and CH_PASSWORD credentials. This approach helps to avoid placing sensitive data directly in the code.\n\nAll mentioned environment variables will be set up later when submitting a Spark job to the cluster.\n\n2. Upload the necessary files to the bucket\n\nFind out the name of the Cloud Storage bucket used by the cluster:\n\n   Run the script to get information about Spark clusters in the project:\n\n            from mlplatform_client import MLPlatform\n\n      REFRESH_TOKEN  ''\n\n      mlp  MLPlatform(REFRESH_TOKEN)\n      print(mlp.get_clusters())\n\n      Details about the clusters will be displayed.\n\n   Find out the information you need:\n\n      cluster identifier (contained in the id field);\n      Cloud Storage bucket name (contained in the s3_bucket_name field).\n\nUpload files to the sparkfiles directory of this bucket:\n\n   the queryclickhouse.py file with the Spark application code;\n   the clickhousejdbc0.5.0shaded.jar file with the JDBC driver for ClickHouse.\n\n     The link contains a shaded version of the JAR file, which includes all the necessary dependencies for the driver. This makes it easier to use the driver with the Spark application and to work with JAR files when submitting a Spark job.\n\n     If necessary, download another version of the driver from the Maven repository. In this case, in the script below, replace the driver version with the correct one.\n\n\n   When uploading files, do not change the default ACL selected (private).\n\n\nWhen submitting a Spark job, the paths to the files uploaded to the bucket will be specified. The Cloud Spark cluster already has access to objects from this bucket, no additional configuration is needed.\n\n3. Send the Spark job to the cluster\n\nCreate a clickhousesecret.yaml file with the following contents:\n\n      apiVersion: v1\n   kind: Secret\n   metadata:\n     name: clickhousesecret\n   stringData:\n     CH_USER: user_spark\n     CH_PASSWORD:\n\n   This file describes a Kubernetes secret that stores user credentials for connecting to a ClickHouse instance.\n\nSubmit the job to the cluster by executing the script:\n\n      from mlplatform_client import MLPlatform\n\n   REFRESH_TOKEN  ''\n   CLUSTER_ID  ''\n   BUCKET_NAME  ''\n   CLICKHOUSE_IP  ''\n\n   CLICKHOUSE_JDBC_DRIVER  'clickhousejdbc0.5.0shaded.jar'\n   JOB_NAME  'clickhousesparkjob'\n\n   mlp  MLPlatform(refresh_tokenREFRESH_TOKEN)\n\n   spark_job_manifest  mlp.get_default_manifest(cluster_idCLUSTER_ID, job_nameJOB_NAME)\n\n   spark_job_manifest.main_app_file  f's3a://BUCKET_NAME/sparkfiles/queryclickhouse.py'\n   spark_job_manifest.add_jars(f's3a://BUCKET_NAME/sparkfiles/CLICKHOUSE_JDBC_DRIVER')\n\n   spark_job_manifest.add_driver_env(\n       \n           'name': 'CH_IP', 'value': CLICKHOUSE_IP,\n           'name': 'CH_DRIVER_JAR', 'value': CLICKHOUSE_JDBC_DRIVER\n       )\n\n   spark_job_manifest.add_executor_env(\n       \n           'name': 'CH_IP', 'value': CLICKHOUSE_IP,\n           'name': 'CH_DRIVER_JAR', 'value': CLICKHOUSE_JDBC_DRIVER\n       )\n\n   mlp.create_secret_from_yaml(cluster_idCLUSTER_ID, secret_yaml_path'clickhousesecret.yaml')\n   spark_job_manifest.add_driver_env_from(\"secretRef\": \"name\": \"clickhousesecret\")\n   spark_job_manifest.add_executor_env_from(\"secretRef\": \"name\": \"clickhousesecret\")\n\n   spark_job_info  mlp.spark_submit_job(cluster_idCLUSTER_ID, manifestspark_job_manifest)\n   print(spark_job_info)\n\n   Information about the submitted task will be displayed, for example:\n\n      Job: clickhousesparkjob, status: SUBMITTED, created_at: ...\n\n   The files required to run the Spark application were previously uploaded into the bucket used by the cluster. The default manifest for a Spark job does not contain information about where the required files are located. Therefore, the missing information has been added to the manifest:\n\n   The path to the Spark application executable file in spark_job_manifest.main_app_file;\n   A list of paths to the JAR files needed by the application (in this particular case, only one JDBC driver file is needed). The spark_job_manifest.add_jars() function is used to add the paths to these files.\n\n   Also, the values of required environment variables are added to the manifest. The variables CH_USER and CH_PASSWORD are used for authentication in ClickHouse, so their values are extracted from the Kubernetes clickhousesecret secret. This secret was previously created from the clickhousesecret.yaml file.\n\n4. Track the status of the Spark job\n\nMake sure that the result of executing the SQL query to ClickHouse appears in the job logs. If the result does not appear, run the script to retrieve the logs again: intermediate job logs may be displayed at the time when the job has not yet completed.\n\n      from mlplatform_client import MLPlatform\n\n   REFRESH_TOKEN  ''\n   CLUSTER_ID  ''\n   JOB_NAME  'clickhousesparkjob'\n\n   mlp  MLPlatform(REFRESH_TOKEN)\n\n   logs  mlp.spark_job_logs(CLUSTER_ID, JOB_NAME)\n   print(logs)\n\n   Example of partial output when the job completes successfully\n\n      ...\n   Reading ClickHouse table\n   ...\n\n   +++\n                   name               value\n   +++\n           VERSION_FULL ClickHouse 22.8.4.7\n       VERSION_DESCRIBE    v22.8.4.7stable\n        VERSION_INTEGER            22008004\n                 SYSTEM               Linux\n        VERSION_GITHASHbaad27bcd2f8f9406...\n       VERSION_REVISION               54465\n           VERSION_DATE                    \n             BUILD_TYPE      RelWithDebInfo\n       SYSTEM_PROCESSOR              x86_64\n          CMAKE_VERSION              3.16.3\n             C_COMPILER   /usr/bin/clang14\n     C_COMPILER_VERSION              14.0.6\n           CXX_COMPILER /usr/bin/clang++14\n   CXX_COMPILER_VERSION              14.0.6\n                C_FLAGS gcctoolchain...\n              CXX_FLAGS gcctoolchain...\n             LINK_FLAGS gcctoolchain...\n   BUILD_COMPILE_DEF...HAS_RESERVED_IDEN...\n                 STATIC                  ON\n   USE_EMBEDDED_COMP...                   1\n   +++\n   only showing top 20 rows\n\n   Finished reading ClickHouse table\n   ...\n\n\n(Optional) Get information about events in the cluster.

The options listed below define the lifecycle of just such a cluster. The cluster returns to the active state when a new Spark job is started.\n\n      Available options:\n\n      Destroy after inactivity: when the specified time expires, the inactive cluster will be automatically deleted.\n\n        By default, the option is disabled, and the cluster exists until it is manually deleted. This option is useful in clusters used for onetime tasks.\n\n      Suspend cluster after inactivity: when the specified time expires, the inactive cluster will go into sleep mode. In this mode, only cluster node disks are charged, computing resources are not charged.\n\n        The cluster will be brought out of sleep mode when a new Spark job is started.\n\n        By default, the option is disabled, and the cluster runs until it is deleted, even if there are no Spark jobs running in it.

Cloud Voice is not always able to correctly pronounce the phrase in Latin.\nNumerals and abbreviations are best written in text. For example, \"Sokolnikov Square  5 sq. km, and Monaco  about 2\". It would be more correct to issue it like this: “Sokolnikov Square is five square kilometers, and Monaco is about two.”\nPut in quotation marks the letters that you need to pronounce separately. For example: \"City with the letter \"O\"\". Add vowels to consonants: “Be”, “Ve”, “Ge”.\nAvoid complex sentences with an abundance of turns. It is better to divide the sentence into several simple ones.\n\nAccuracy of pronunciation\n\nTo improve the accuracy of text recognition, you can use special characters:\n Sign  What does \n    \n   stress. Placed before a vowel.   ^  Intonation. Placed before and after the word.   .  Pause. Placed after the word.    and   Transcription. Placed before and after the word. Example: MercedesMercedes\\eu \n\nAccent\n\nSometimes there may be an error in emphasis. For example, \"Once Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy challenged Ivan Sergeevich Turgenev to a duel.\" In such a case, we recommend using \"\\`\".\n\nGet:\n\n\"Once Lev Nikolayevich Tolst\\`oy challenged Ivan Sergeevich Turgenev to a duel.\"\n\nThere may also be an error with accents in words with \"ё\". It is important not to miss this letter when writing the text, otherwise instead of \"Blinded\" you get \"Blinded\".\n\nIntonation\n\nIf you want to emphasize a particular word, use \"^\".\n\n Was                                                     Became                                                   \n    \n Russia has its own Rome.\" Emphasis on the word \"Rome\".  \"Russia has ^its own^ Rome.\" Emphasis on the word \"own\". \n\nPause\n\nIf you want to add pauses to your speech, you can separate the sentence with a period.\n\n Was                                                          Became                                                 \n    \n \"Who was there just not: lions, tigers, giraffes, monkeys.\"  “Who was not there. Lions. Tigers. Giraffes. Monkeys\". \n\nIf Cloud Voice does not pause between sentences, then this is solved by a simple line break. Example:\n“And you can also control the music with your voice.\nBy the way! Completely forgot\".\n\nTranscription\n\nSometimes synthesis reads words incorrectly. For example, in a word, the letters “O” and “G” are emphasized too strongly, so that a “Vologda dialect” appears. To make the word sound more familiar, it has to be written with “kavota” errors. Another example is Peter (city). Cloud Voice pronounces it as \"Peter\". To fix this, we write a transcription with an intentional error: \"P'itir\".\n\nSince in the application, in addition to the voice, there is also a text answer  errors are unacceptable.\n\nIn this case, we write both versions of the word. Moreover, the word is first written as it should look in the text, and then as it should be written for speech synthesis. And enclose them in curly brackets. It turns out: I saw someonekavot strange.\nWe do the same with foreign words that synthesis can read incorrectly: which is better MercedesMerced\\es or BMWBeemv\\e?\n\nProblem cases\n\nBasically, problems can arise when the Latin alphabet is used. For example, black reads like \"black\" and is pronounced quickly, which together gives consonance with another word. You can correct this error using the symbol  (hyphen): \"blek\".\n\nUnforeseen situations can also arise with Russian words. For example, “Happy New Year! Your Yul'a and Marusya. There is an accent here, but even if it is present, “Yula” is pronounced. You can fix it in the way described above.\n\nDifficulties may arise with reading a foreign combination of letters th: theater, feather, the etc. Such words are pronounced with a Russian accent. To make speech closer to the pronunciation of native speakers, use the transcription through the letters \"f\", \"v\" and \"d\":\n\ntheatre → **fieta feather → fevar\nthe* (national) → *te** (national)\n","url":"/en/ml/cloud-voice/service-management/pronunciation-quality","categoryPartialPath":"/en/ml","description":"","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Machine learning in the Cloud","link":"/en/ml","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Voice","link":"/en/ml/cloud-voice","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"5183fc57-8c72-43dc-bea0-a9d75537aa45","title":"Tariffication","data":" Service                                  Cost                       \n    \n Speech synthesis                         1 ruble / 1000 characters  \n Speech recognition from audio files      0.50 rubles / minute       \n Speech recognition from streaming audio  0.50 rubles / minute       \n","url":"/en/ml/cloud-voice/tariffication","categoryPartialPath":"/en/ml","description":"","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Machine learning in the Cloud","link":"/en/ml","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Cloud Voice","link":"/en/ml/cloud-voice","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"f0cb9be0-7082-4c84-bffb-b747a678a371","title":"General description","data":"Vision is a face, object, process recognition technology based on machine learning and artificial neural networks.

In response, it receives 2 tokens and a lifetime.\nApplication saves tokens and uses access token for subsequent image recognition requests.\nWhen the access token lifetime comes to an end, requests for image recognition will stop passing:\n\n  \"status\":401,\"body\":\"authorization failed, provider: mcs, token: vMA3Pjyno6tvCdo8MeDQ8xYT(...), reason: CONDITION/UNAUTHORIZED, Access Token invalid\"\n\nYou will need to refresh the access token with a refresh token.\n\nGetting the first token\n\nWe need to send a request to the authorization server with the client ID and secret key:\n\ncurl X POST location 'https://mcs.mail.ru/auth/oauth/v1/token' \\\n   header 'ContentType: application/json' \\\n   data '\n   \"client_id\":\"\",\n   \"client_secret\": \"\",\n   \"grant_type\":\"client_credentials\"\n   '\n\nQuery parameters\n\n Parameter  Description \n  \n client_id  mcs1017666666.ml.vision.f7kk1rmajnhfy \n client_secret  5FYLyJoex37xw45TJShx6dGifnouhdsOIndbsyg78ejnbs \n grant_type  client_credentials \n\nclient_id\n\nThe client ID on the mcs platform is taken from the management console page (https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/services/machinelearning/vision/).\n\nclient_secret\n\nThe secret key is taken from the management console page (https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/services/machinelearning/vision/).\n\ngrant_type\n\nType of token to generate:\n\n\"grant_type\":\"client_credentials\"** — generation of access_token and refresh_token by client_secret (only for the first time).\n\"grant_type\":\"refresh_token\"** — generation of access_token via refresh_token to update access token.\n\nResponse to request\n\n\n  \"refresh_token\": \"Q9fdfT49CZ19rfohBC4y8Du6PE89989898hghgh\",\n  \"access_token\": \"vMA3Pjyno6tvCdo8MeDQ8xfgbibiubr9r\",\n  \"expired_in\": \"3600\",\n  scope: \n    \"objects\": 1,\n    video: 1\n    \"persons\": 1\n  \n\n\n Parameter  Description \n  \n access_token  Access token for client authorization in image and video recognition requests \n refresh_token  Token to generate access_token when the old one expires \n expired_in  Lifetime of the generated access_token in seconds \n\nRefresh token\n\nTo generate access_token via refresh_token, send a request to the authorization server:\n\ncurl X POST location 'https://mcs.mail.ru/auth/oauth/v1/token' \\\nheader 'ContentType: application/json' \\\ndata '\n\"client_id\":\"\",\n\"refresh_token\":\"\",\n\"grant_type\":\"refresh_token\"\n'\n\nResponse to request\n\n\n  \"refresh_token\": \"Q9fdfT49CZ19rfohBC4y8Du6PE89989898hghgh\",\n  \"access_token\": \"vMA3Pjyno6tvCdo8MeDQ8xfgbibiubr9r\",\n  \"expired_in\": \"3600\",\n  scope: \n    \"objects\": 1,\n    video: 1\n    \"persons\": 1\n  \n\n\n Parameter  Description \n \n access_token Access token for client authorization in image and video recognition requests \n refresh_token Token to generate an access_token when the old one expires\n expired_in The lifetime of the generated access_token in seconds \n","url":"/en/ml/vision/quick-start/auth-vision","categoryPartialPath":"/en/ml","description":"","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Machine learning in the Cloud","link":"/en/ml","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Vision","link":"/en/ml/vision","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"fcfe8b2e-1e80-44aa-b02a-23c2e6fa2c1c","title":"Creation and connection to the service","data":"The machine learning service is enabled by default in VK Cloud projects.

It provides collecting, storing, reading, displaying and processing logs in a single interface in the cloud.\n\nThe service centralizes the logs of the entire product system in a single control panel, stores records and makes it convenient to search and work with them. It also helps to control the operation of applications and debug them if necessary.\n\nAdvantages\n\nRealtime data. You have access to the logs of all your applications or services in real time.\n\nConvenient search. In Cloud Logging, you can search, view and analyze logs using text search with additional filters.\n\nFlexible settings. You can customize the service for your tasks using the API for reading and collecting logs. For example, you can set the storage time for logs, set up roles for working with logs.\n\nAvailability and reliability. We will ensure the operability and fault tolerance of the service and guarantee its availability according to the SLA.\n\nSafety. In Cloud Logging, all data is securely protected: we store logs of each application group isolated from each other in the cloud.

Grouping by projects is convenient when there are several different tasks, each of which requires its own service infrastructure with its own individual settings. In addition, the project organization of work helps:\n\ndelimit user access to resources and data;\ntrack resource consumption separately for each of the tasks.\n\nWhen registering a new user account in VK Cloud, a project is automatically created in which the current user is registered as the owner. The project owner can create new projects and invite users to all his projects by assigning them roles.

You can conserve the project to stop debiting funds.\n\n\n\nA number of services may have their own terms for freezing and deleting objects.\n\n\n  Example for the Object storage service\n\nWhen the payment account balance becomes negative, the service objects are frozen.\n\n    All the time while the objects are frozen, the service charges for data storage, while the objects have read access.\n\nIf the payment account balance of the project does not become positive within 30 days, the objects are blocked.\n\n    When objects are blocked, writeoffs for them stop. There is no access to objects, including read access. 30 days after switching to this state, if the payment account balance does not become positive, the objects are deleted.\n\nFor more information about the service, see Object storage.\n\n\n\nAfter the payment account balance becomes positive, the services in the project are automatically activated after a while.

If the quotas allow you to create another virtual machine, and there are enough resources (vCPU, memory and disk space) to create it, the virtual machine is successfully created.\n\nQuotas are not shared between several projects of the same owner and are not inherited by one project from another. The list of quotas varies for different regions.\n\nAfter activating the services, basic quotas become available to the project. They have default values that apply to all new projects in the region.\n\nQuotas can be viewed:\n\nshort list — in the management console\nextended list — via the OpenStack CLI\n\nThere are implicit quotas that cannot be seen in any way, they manifest themselves as error messages when trying to create a new object. An example of an implicit quota is quota for the number of projects, which can be created by a single user.\n\nQuotas are closely related to technical limits.\n\nQuotas and technical limits\n\nTechnical limits are the limitations of the platform due to the features of the VK Cloud architecture.\n\nSome of the limits are strict, they cannot be exceeded physically. For example, the limit on 4 GPUs per instance is related to the limitation of KVM technology, which does not allow connecting more than 4 video cards to one virtual machine.\n\nOther limits are not related to physical limitations and are based on the operational requirements of the services. For example, network restrictions are introduced to ensure optimal network performance and stable operation.\n\nThere are no corresponding quotas for some technical limits.\n\nQuotas can be increased within the technical limits by contacting technical support.\n\nNonrigid limits can be exceeded — either also through technical support, or independently. However, exceeding these limits can negatively affect the stability of work.\n\nThe following is a list of quotas and limits for the Moscow region.\n\nCommon\n\ncols\"2,1,1,1,1\", options\"header\"\n\n Parameter\n Quota\n Basic quota\n Limit\n Hard\n\n The number of projects the user has\n\n 5 pcs.\n 100 pcs.\n\n\n Number of administrators in the project\n\n 50 people\n 50 people\n\n\n Number of SSH key pairs\n keypairs in CLI\n 100 key pairs\n not limited\n\n\n\n\nVirtual machines\n\nTotal number of VMs and vCPUs\ncols\"2,1,1,1,1,1\", options\"header\"\n\n Parameter\n Quota in PA\n Quota in CLI\n Basic quota\n Limit\n Hard\n\n Number of instances in the project\n Virtual machines\n instances\n 6 pcs.\n 1000 pcs.\n\n\n Number of vCPUs in the project\n vCPU\n cores\n 9 pcs.\n not limited\n\n\n Total amount of RAM in the project\n RAM\n ram\n 10240 MB\n not limited\n\n\n\n\nThe limit on the number of instances in the project can be exceeded if the corresponding quota is increased upon request to technical support.\n\n\n\nNo more than 1000 virtual machines can be displayed in the management console.\n\nLimits without quotas\n\n Parameter                                        Limit          Hard \n\n Number of vCPUs per instance            32 pcs.             \n Number of HighFreq vCPUs per instance  24 pcs.        \n Number of GPUs per instance             4 pcs.         \n The amount of RAM per instance          1024 GB       \n\nLimits on the number of processors (vCPU and HighFreq vCPU) and RAM are associated with the limitations of standard hypervisors.

After appointing another user as the owner, you will switch with him roles.\n\n\n\nA change of ownership is possible in any state of the project balance.\n\n\n\nFollow the preparatory steps:\n\n    If necessary, untie the payment card from the project by contacting technical support.\n\n    Make sure that the user you want to make the owner:\n\n        Added to the list of members and accepted the invitation to the project.\n\n            In this case, it is displayed in the list with the activation status Yes.\n\n        (Optional) Has the role of superadministrator, project administrator or user administrator (IAM) in the project.\n\n            This will allow you to control the change of roles after you cease to be the owner.\n\n        Agree to accept the project.\n\n            The transfer of the project is possible only with the consent of the new owner.\n\nContact technical support on behalf of the current owner, provide the following information:\n\n    project id (PID);\n    the new owner's email address.\n\n(Optional) Check the role change in the list of project members.\n\n\n\nThe new owner may need to link a payment card, if the project does not have a linked card, and confirm phone number.\n\nProject conservation\n\nIf you want to suspend work on a project, mothball the project to stop debiting funds. If the project goes into negative territory, it will be frozen with subsequent deletion of objects and data.\n\nTo preserve the project:\n\nDetermine which data from the project you want to save:\n\n    Click on the user name in the header of the management console page, select Balance and payments.\n    Expand the menu of each service to see the objects in which data is stored and their size.\n\nStop all the VMs that you want to save data from.\nTransfer or copy all the necessary data.\n\n    For example, create and export disk images of the virtual machines stopped in the previous step.\n\nDelete all objects that are charged or occupy disk space — floating IP addresses, disks, buckets, load balancers, and others.\n\n    The full list of such objects is also on the page Balance and payments.\n\n    Since the boot disks of virtual machines cannot be deleted separately, delete VMs.\n\n    Objects that do not consume resources — for example, networks and subnets — can be left in the project.\n\nYou will be able to reactivate the project after any period of time by uploading the saved data to it and restoring the infrastructure.\n\nTransferring objects between projects\n\nYou can transfer disks between projects. This allows you to transfer virtual machines between projects.\n\nDisk transfer is possible only within one region. If the projects are located in different regions, upload locally the disk image and download it to the new project.\n\nCurrently, transferring PaaS service objects between projects is not supported. For example, the virtual machine on which the database was deployed can be moved to another project only as a regular virtual machine. It is not possible to transfer such a virtual machine as a database instance or create a database instance with a disk transferred from another project.\n\nBy contacting technical support, it is possible to transfer objects:\n\nfloating IP addresses;\naddresses of the external networks.\n\nViewing project quotas\n\n\n\nManagement console\nOpenStack CLI\n\n\n\nQuotas for the most frequently used resources are displayed on the main page of the management console.\n\nTo see a more complete list of quotas and find out detailed information about each quota from the list:\n\nClick on the user name in the header of the management console page, select from the dropdown list Quotas management. The quotas page opens.\n\n    The same page is available if you select Project settings and go to the Quotas tab.\n\nClick on the iconInformation to the right of the required quota. Information will be displayed about which objects and in which services the quota is spent.\n\nAn extended list of quotas for the project can be obtained through the OpenStack CLI. Information about all quotas and the possibilities of increasing them in the section Quotas and limits.\n\n\n\n\nTo get an extended list of quotas for a project:\n\nMake sure that OpenStack client is installed and authenticate to the project.\nRun the command:\n\n        openstack quota show\n\n    Example of command output for the Moscow region\n\n        +++\n     Field

This example creates an NFS and grants read/write access from two IP addresses. Add the text from the example below and correct the settings for your NFS.\n\nCreate a virtual network for NFS\n\nWhen creating an NFS, you must specify a network and subnet on which this resource will be created. You can create a network and subnet according to instruction and specify them in the vkcs_networking_network and vkcs_networking_subnet resources in the example below.\n\nIf you use a network and subnet created in another way, specify them as data source vkcs_networking_network and vkcs_networking_subnet instead of specifying the corresponding resources.\n\nCreate an NFS\n\nTo create an NFS, you need the following objects:\n\nResources:\n\n  vkcs_networking_network: a network on which the NFS will be created. In the example below, a network named sfs is created.\n  vkcs_networking_subnet: a subnet of the network. In the example: sfs.\n  vkcs_sharedfilesystem_sharenetwork: use this resource to set up a shared network. The shared network stores information that NFS servers can use when creating the NFS. The following arguments are supported:\n\n    name: a name for the shared network. Changing this argument updates the name of the existing shared network.\n    neutron_net_id: the UUID of the Neutron network when setting up or updating the shared network. Changing this argument updates the existing shared network if it is not being used by shared resources.\n    neutron_subnet_id: the UUID of the Neutron subnet when setting up or updating the shared network. Changing this argument updates the existing shared network if it is not being used by shared resources.\n\n  vkcs_sharedfilesystem_share: use this resource to set up a share. The following arguments are supported:\n\n    name: the share name. Changing this argument updates the name of the existing share.\n    description: a humanreadable description of the share. Changing this argument updates the description of the existing share.\n    share_proto: the sharing protocol, it can be NFS, CIFS, CEPHFS, GLUSTERFS, HDFS or MAPRFS. Changing this argument creates a new share.\n    share_type: the share type. If you omit this argument, the default share type is used.\n    size: the share size, in gigabytes. The requested share size cannot exceed the allowed quota in GB. Changing this argument changes the size of the existing share.\n    share_network_id: the ID of the network with the NFS server.\n\n  vkcs_sharedfilesystem_share_access: use this resource to manage share lists. The following arguments are supported:\n\n    share_id: the UUID of the share that you have been granted access to.\n    access_type: the access rule type. Can be one of the following: ip, user, cert, or cephx.\n    access_to: the value specifying access. This can be either an IP address or a username verified by the configured Cloud Networks security service.\n    access_level: the level of access to the shared resource.

Each network consists of one subnet.\nRouters with interfaces in the corresponding subnets are created for each network.\nThe public network router is configured to access the external network. Therefore, floating IP addresses can be assigned to objects in this network.\nEach network has a port that corresponds to its only subnet. A commonrouter virtual machine is connected to these ports, acting as a router between the two networks.\nThe routers have the configured static routes that lead to another subnet through the virtual machine port.\nA virtual machine is created in each subnet. The virtual machine on the public network has a floating IP address.\n\n  These machines are used to test the routing settings between networks: a successful ping between them will indicate the correct configuration.\n\nExample Infrastructure SchemeparamsnoBordertrue\n\nBefore you start\n\nCheck out the available resources and quotas for the region in which you plan to create a cluster.

It is recommended that you run this command before running the apply command to ensure that the results are as intended.\nterraform apply — builds or changes the infrastructure. The command will show the execution plan and require a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer (unless the autoapprove flag is used, which will cause the command to be executed automatically).\nterraform refresh — updates the local state file with respect to real resources. This ensures that Terraform has an accurate idea of what is in the current environment.\nterraform destroy — deletes infrastructure managed by Terraform. This will permanently remove everything created and stored in the state file from the cluster.\n\nBefore using the commands, switch to the working directory that contains the .tf configuration files.\n\nIn cases where commands are used in automation scripts, for convenience, the chdir option is used to change the working directory before applying the command:\n\nterraform chdirterraform/configuration apply\n","url":"/en/tools-for-using-services/terraform/reference/commands","categoryPartialPath":"/en/tools-for-using-services","description":"","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Tools for working with services","link":"/en/tools-for-using-services","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Terraform","link":"/en/tools-for-using-services/terraform","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"de47c0fe-6e0d-4d2f-b932-d7f400bb881f","title":"Configuration files","data":"When creating resources, Terraform works with configuration files. They have the .tf extension.\n\nIt is recommended to create a separate working directory for each VK Cloud project. The following files are placed in the working directory:\n\nthe provider config file (projectspecific);\nthe configuration files of the resources you are planning to create.\n\nFor correct Terraform operation, an additional file is required — the Terraform mirror config file.\n\nThe Terraform provider config file\n\nThe file contains the settings of Terraform providers and user authentication details for the current project.\n\nThe file can have any name. It is recommended to name it provider.tf to highlight that the file contains the key settings for connecting to VK Cloud.\n\nThe file must be present in all Terraform working directories.\n\nThe file is available for download in your management console, on the Project settings page, on the Terraform tab. The downloaded file has the name vkcs_provider.tf and contains the settings of one provider (vkcs). After downloading the file, edit it — specify your account password in the password argument.\n\nAn example of the file contents:\n\nterraform \n    required_providers \n        vkcs  \n            source  \"vkcs/vkcs\"\n        \n    \n\n\nprovider \"vkcs\" \nYour user account.\n    username  \"\"\n\nThe password of the account\n    password  \"\"\n\nThe tenant token can be taken from the project Settings tab  > API keys.\nProject ID will be our token.\n    project_id  \"\"\n\nRegion name\n    region  \"\"\n\n    auth_url  \"\"\n\n\nThe file consists of the following sections:\n\nterraform.required_providers  — a list of Terraform providers required for operation. To work with VK Cloud, the vkcs provider must be specified, its source and versions. If you are going to use additional providers, add them to this section.\nprovider \"vkcs\"  — settings for user authentication in the project:\n\n  password: specify your account password;\n  username, project_id, region: the values in the file that is downloaded from the management console are valid for working with the current project. These values can also be obtained in your management console, on the Project settings page, on the Terraform tab.\n\n  The values of some arguments depend on the region:\n\n  region:\n\n    for Moscow region: RegionOne;\n    for Kazakhstan region: kz;\n\n  auth_url:\n\n    for Moscow region: https://infra.mail.ru:35357/v3/;\n    for Kazakhstan region: https://kz.infra.mail.ru:35357/v3/.\n\nResources configuration files\n\nResource configuration files describe the resources created via Terraform, their settings and dependencies.\n\nResource configuration files can have any names. Examples in this documentation use the following naming standards:\n\nvariables.tf — variables that are used in the configuration. Setting frequently changed parameters as variables makes it easier to change the infrastructure configuration for a new project.\nmain.tf — contains a description of the main resource that is created in a scenario. For example, in the scenario for creating a virtual machine the main.tf file should typically contain the description of a virtual machine.\n\nSometimes files are named after the types of the resources they describe:\n\nnetwork.tf — the description of the cloud network.\nkubernetes.tf — the description of Kubernetes resources.\n\nA typical configuration contains:\n\nresource \"resource_type\" \"resource_name\"  — describes the resource being created, such as a network, a subnet, a Kubernetes cluster, or a database cluster.\ndata \"data_type\" \"data_name\"  — allows you to use data specified outside the Terraform configuration that exists in the cloud or locally. For example, VM configuration, cluster template/version, etc.\nvariable \"parameter\"  — input variables. Used to declare variables that are used in the configuration (variables.tf).\noutput \"parameter\"  — output variables. Used to output data to the command line.\n\nTo determine the sequence of creating resources and their dependencies, you can use the depends_on metaargument. The metaargument indicates the resource on which the resource being created depends:\n\ndepends_on  \n    vkcs_kubernetes_cluster.k8scluster,\n\n\nFirst, the resource set by the metaargument is created, then the resource for which the dependency is specified is created.\n\nThe Terraform mirror config file\n\nThe file is required for Terraform startup, it contains the address of the VK Cloud Terraform mirror. The file must be named terraform.rc for Windows and .terraformrc for other OS. The file content is the same for all projects and regions.\n\nThe file is available for download on the Project settings page in your management console, on the Terraform tab. After downloading, the file can be used as is.\n\nThe file must be located:\n\nFor Windows — in the Application Data directory of the user.\nFor other OS — in the home directory of the user.\n\nThe file content for VK Cloud projects:\n\nprovider_installation \n    network_mirror \n        url  \"https://terraformmirror.mcs.mail.ru\"\n        include  \"registry.terraform.io//\"\n    \n    direct \n        exclude  \"registry.terraform.io//\"\n    \n\n","url":"/en/tools-for-using-services/terraform/reference/configuration","categoryPartialPath":"/en/tools-for-using-services","description":"","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Tools for working with services","link":"/en/tools-for-using-services","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Terraform","link":"/en/tools-for-using-services/terraform","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"72074075-db91-44c6-a4fa-08ea60d1b2a6","title":"API access control","data":"Activation of API access is necessary to work with VK Cloud using the public API and additional tools such as OpenStack CLI, Terraform, kubectl and others.\n\nActivate API access\n\nEnable twofactor authentication.\nClick the username in the header of the page and enable API access in one of the ways:\n\n      Project settings\n      Account settings\n\n\n      In the dropdown menu, select the Project settings option.\n      On the API access tab, click Activate API access.\n\n\n      In the dropdown menu, select the Account settings option.\n      Go to the Security tab.\n      In the Additional accesses section, enable the API access option.\n\n\nDeactivate API access\n\nEnable twofactor authentication if it has been disabled.\nClick the username in the header of the page and select Account settings.\nOn the Security tab, disable the API access option.\n","url":"/en/tools-for-using-services/api/rest-api/enable-api","categoryPartialPath":"/en/tools-for-using-services","description":"Enabling or disabling access to the VK Cloud API.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Tools for working with services","link":"/en/tools-for-using-services","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"API","link":"/en/tools-for-using-services/api","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"449c7801-b300-44e3-9f11-3d3bd5e1b7d1","title":"Getting a Keystone access token","data":"A Keystone token is required to work with some components and resources of the VK Cloud platform via their API.

This command is a combination of the docker create and the docker start commands.\n\nThe operation will be demonstrated for the previously pulled ubuntu image:\n\nCreate and run the container:\n\n      sudo docker run it ubuntu\n\n   After running the container, you will get access to the container's terminal (TTY) with the bash session (this is achieved with it options). As a result, you will get the bash command line prompt, which looks like:\n\n      root@8502eb90112b:/#\n\n   In this example output, 8502eb90112b is an identifier of the created container.\n\nTo check that the container is operational, install Node.js into it.\n\n   Run the command:\n\n            apt update && apt install nodejs y\n\n   View the information about installed Node.js version:\n\n            node v\n\n      Example output:\n\n            v12.22.9\n\nExit the container's bash command line:\n\n      exit\n\n   The container will be stopped.\n\nManaging containers\n\nTo manage containers it is necessary to obtain their identifiers. To do this, view the list of the containers:\n\n   The list of all containers\n   The list of the running containers\n\n\n      sudo docker ps a\n\n\n      sudo docker ps\n\n   Example docker ps a output\n\n      CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND       CREATED          STATUS                       PORTS     NAMES\n   8502eb90112b   ubuntu        \"/bin/bash\"   11 minutes ago   Exited (127) 7 seconds ago             sharp_tharp\n   794ef863c235   helloworld   \"/hello\"      19 hours ago     Exited (0) 19 hours ago                dazzling_keldysh\n\n\n   A container identifier is listed in the CONTAINER ID column.\n\nManage a container, using its identifier:\n\n   Start container\n   Stop container\n   Remove container\n\n\n      sudo docker start\n\n   Example command to start the ubuntu container with the 8502eb90112b identifier:\n\n      sudo docker start 8502eb90112b\n\n\n      sudo docker stop\n\n   Example command to stop the ubuntu container with the 8502eb90112b identifier:\n\n      sudo docker stop 8502eb90112b\n\n\n      sudo docker rm\n\n   It is impossible to remove the running container. Either stop it first, or do removal with the force option.\n\n   Example command to remove the ubuntu container with the 8502eb90112b identifier:\n\n      sudo docker rm 8502eb90112b\n\n","url":"/en/cases/cases-docker-ce/using-docker-ce","categoryPartialPath":"/en/cases","description":"How to use installed Docker CE.","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"How-to guides","link":"/en/cases","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Installing and using Docker CE on Linux","link":"/en/cases/cases-docker-ce","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"1b4993c3-fe71-48ed-be6e-6c226c9eef19","title":"Configuring Application Auto-Deployment to a Kubernetes Cluster","data":"In this article, we will look at how to set up autodeployment of an application to a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nBefore that:\n\nInstall and configure Docker.\nInstall and configure GitLab.\nInstall and configure Harbor.\n\nSet up GitLabrunner\n\nGitLabrunner is an environment for autobuilding GitLab projects. To set up autobuild, install and register runner with GitLab. You can register a specific runner for each project (specific runner) or a common runner for multiple projects (shared runner). Let's set up a common runner.\n\nFor this:\n\nSign in to the GitLab web interface with administrator rights:\n\n\n\nCopy the registration token and run the following in the console on the server where GitLabrunner is installed:\n\nroot@ubuntustd32440gb:~# docker exec it gitlabrunner gitlabrunner register n url https:/// executor docker registrationtoken ua2k238fbMtAxMBBRf_z  description \"sharedrunner\" dockerimage\"docker:dind\" taglist \"shared_runner\" dockerprivileged dockervolumes /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker .sock\n\n\n\nAttention\n\n\\taglist  specifies the tags that runner will accept. Further in the project, this tag is specified so that the project is assembled by this runner.\n\n\\dockerprivileged and dockervolumes are required for the running Docker container to have access to the parent Docker to build images (details read here).\n\n\n\nAs a result, runner will be displayed in the web interface:\n\n\n\nSet the runtime variables. To do this, select Settings / CI CD and next to Variables click Expand:\n\n\n\nSet a few variables that will be used later in the autobuild file .gitlabci.yml:\n\n\n\nVariables:\n\nDOCKER_USER  user to access the repository in Harbor. In our example, k8s.\nDOCKER_PASSWORD  The password for the k8s user that you entered when you created the user in Harbor.\n\nPlease note that Masked is enabled for the password  thanks to this, when you try to display text in a variable in the script, it is masked and the password is not visible.\n\nDOCKER_REGISTRY is the name of the host where the Harbor is located. In our example, .\n\nSet up the autobuild file\n\nGo to the directory with the downloaded repository and in a text editor create a .gitlabci.yml file with the following content:\n\nimage:docker:latest\n\nstages:\n  builds\n  test\n  release\n\nvariables:\n  REGISTRY_URL: https://$DOCKER_REGISTRY:8443\n  IMAGE: $DOCKER_REGISTRY:8443/$DOCKER_USER/$CI_PROJECT_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME\n  RELEASE: $DOCKER_REGISTRY:8443/$DOCKER_USER/$CI_PROJECT_NAME:latest\n\nbefore_script:\n   docker login $REGISTRY_URL u $DOCKER_USER p $DOCKER_PASSWORD\n\nbuild:\n  stage:builds\n  tags:\n    shared_runner\n  script:\n   cd app && docker build pull t $IMAGE .\n   docker push $IMAGE\n\nrelease:\n  stage: release\n  tags:\n    shared_runner\n  script:\n    docker pull $IMAGE\n    docker tag $IMAGE $RELEASE\n    docker push $RELEASE\n  only:\nmaster\n\nConsider this file.\n\nGeneral Purpose Variables:\n\nimage  specifies the docker image in which the build will run. Since we are building a Docker image, we need an image that contains the utilities we need to build. Usually image docker:latest is used.\nstages  describes the stages of image assembly. In our example, the test stage is skipped.\n\nVariables used for work:\n\nbefore_script  the stage that is executed first. We sign in to the register using the variables that are specified in the GitLab runner settings.\nbuild  image build. Standard build of a Docker image using a Dockerfile in the repository.\n\n\n\nImportant!\n\ntags: shared_runner is the tag that was specified when registering the runner. Specifying this tag in the .gitlabci.yml file allows GitLabrunner to execute this script. After assembly, the assembled image is entered into the registry with the CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME tag. For details on the variables that can be used during the build read the article). In our example, since we are committing to the master branch, the image name will be k8s/k8sconfdemo:master.\n\n\n\nrelease  final image generation section. In our example, we simply take the image built in the previous stage, add the latest tag to it, and upload it to the repository.\n\nUpload the created file to the repository:\n\nashwork:k8sconfdemo git add .\nashwork:k8sconfdemo git commit m \"create .gitlabci.yml\"\nmaster 55dd5fa create .gitlabci.yml\n1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion()\nashwork:k8sconfdemo git push\nEnumeration of objects: 5, done.\nObject count: 100% (5/5), done.\nCompressing changes uses up to 4 streams\nObject compression: 100% (3/3), done.\nObject Writing: 100% (3/3), 299 bytes  299.00 KiB/s, done.\n3 total (2 changes), 0 reused (0 changes)\nTo testrom.ddns.net:ash/k8sconfdemo.git\n7c91eab..55dd5fa master > master\n\nAs soon as the .gitlabci.yml file appears in the repository, GitLab will automatically start building it.\n\nYou can see how the build is going in the GitLab web interface in the project, CI / CD / Pipelines:\n\n\n\nBy clicking on running, you can see the current progress of the build:\n\n\n\nBy clicking on the build stage, you can see the build console and what is happening in it. Example for the build stage:\n\n\n\nExample for the release stage:\n\n\n\nThe console logs show that both build and release completed successfully. The assembled image was posted in the Harbor repository, which can be seen in the corresponding web interface:\n\nDeploying an application to a Kubernetes cluster\n\nAfter successfully building the project, we will set up autodeployment of the application to the Kubernetes cluster. For example, we use Kubernetes cluster from VK Cloud.\n\nAfter the cluster is deployed in the cloud, a configuration file of the form kubernetescluster5011_kubeconfig.yaml is loaded on the local computer, intended for authorization in the cluster for utilities like kubectl.\n\nConnect the configuration file:\n\nashwork:~ export KUBECONFIGkubernetescluster5011_kubeconfig.yaml\n\nMake sure that authorization is successful and the cluster is healthy:\n\nashwork:~ kubectl clusterinfo\nKubernetes master is running at https://89.208.197.244:6443\nCoreDNS is running at https://89.208.197.244:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kubesystem/services/kubedns:dns/proxy\n\nTo further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl clusterinfo dump'.\n\nThe cluster responds.\n\n3 Grant the cluster access rights to the Harbor image repository. To do this, create the following secret:\n\nashwork:~ kubectl create secret dockerregistry myprivateregistry dockerserverhttps://:8443 dockerusernamek8s dockerpassword\nsecret/myprivateregistry created.\nwhere ` is the Harbor server name, ` is the Harbor user k8s password.\n\nVerify that the secret was successfully created:\n\nashwork:~ kubectl get secret myprivateregistry output\"jsonpath.data.\\.dockerconfigjson\"  base64 decode\n\"auths\":\"https://:8443\":\"username\":\"k8s\",\"password\":\"\",\"auth\":\"sdasdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdssd\"%\n\nCreate a deployment.yml file with the following content:\n\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\nname: myapp\nspec:\nselector:\nmatch Labels:\nrun: myapp\ntemplate:\nmetadata:\nlabels:\nrun: myapp\nspec:\ncontainers:\nname:myapp\nimage: :8443/k8s/k8sconfdemo:latest\nimagePullPolicy: Always\nenv:\nname: HTTP_PORT\nvalue: \"8081\"\nports:\ncontainerPort: 8081\nimagePullSecrets:\nname: myprivateregistry\n\nApply this file:\n\nashwork:~ kubectl create f deployment.yaml\ndeployment.apps/myappdeployment created\n\nAfter a while, make sure that the container has risen:\n\nashwork:~ kubectl get pods\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE\nmyappdeployment66d55bcbd5s86m6 1/1 Running 0 39s\n\nCreate a service.yml file:\n\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\nname: myappsvc\nlabels:\nrun: myapp\nspec:\nports:\nprotocol:TCP\nport: 8081\ntargetPort: 8081\nselector:\nrun: myapp\n\nCreate a service:\n\nashwork:~ kubectl create f service.yaml\nservice/myappsvc created\n\nTo provide access to the application from the external network, configure the ingress controller. To do this, create a ingress.yaml file:\n\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\nname: myappingress\nspec:\nrules:\nhost: echo.com\nhttp:\npaths:\npath: /\nbackend:\nserviceName: myappsvc\nservicePort: 8081\n\nIn this file, specify the domain, when accessed, the transition to the application will be performed. You can specify any domain, we will write it locally for tests.\n\nApply the ingress controller:\n\nashwork:~ kubectl create f ingress.yaml\ningress.extensions/myappingress created\n\nView the state of the ingress controller:\n\nashwork:~ kubectl describe ingress myappingress\nName: myappingress\nNamespace:default\naddress:\nDefault backend: defaulthttpbackend:80 ()\nRules:\nHost Path Backends\n \necho.com\n/ myappsvc:8081 (10.100.69.71:8081)\nAnnotations:\nevents:\nType Reason Age From Message\n   \nNormal CREATE 45s nginxingresscontroller Ingress default/myappingress\nNormal UPDATE 5s nginxingresscontroller Ingress default/myappingress\n\nThe external IP address associated with the ingress controller can be viewed in the web interface of the Mail.ru cloud.

It provides storage and management of Git repositories, as well as code version control. GitLab automates CI/CD processes: building, testing, and deploying software. To launch and automatically execute CI/CD tasks, GitLab uses the GitLab Runner application.\n\nBelow is an example of installing the free versions of GitLab and GitLab Runner on a virtual machine running Ubuntu 22.04. The Docker containerization platform and its Docker Compose plugin are used as the installation tool.\n\nPreparatory steps\n\nRegister at VK Cloud.\nCreate a network network1 with internet access and a subnet with the address 10.0.0.0/24.\nCreate a security group gitlab and add inbound permissions to it for the ports:\n\n   80 (HTTP),\n   443 (HTTPS),\n   22 (SSH),\n   35242 (SSH).\n\n   Instead of 35242, you can use any port that is not reserved by the operating system.\n\nCreate a VM running Ubuntu 22.04.\n\n   When selecting VM options, consider the hardware requirements for installing GitLab and GitLab Runner.\n\n   The following VM configuration is used as an example:\n\n     name: OAUbuntudocker;\n     operating system: Ubuntu 22.04;\n     network: network1 with subnet 10.0.0.0/24;\n     flavor: STD2412;\n     network HDD drive: 50 GB;\n     public IP address: assigned, further will be used 185.185.185.185;\n     security groups: default, gitlab.\n\n\n   When creating a VM running Ubuntu, a user is automatically created with the ubuntu name and full rights to use sudo.\n\n\n(Optional) Assign a domain name to the VM to use for accessing GitLab. Do it in one of the following ways:\n\n   If you have a domain, add your VM to it.\n   If you do not have a domain, use, for example, NoIP — one of the services that provides dynamic DNS. For this, install a dynamic update client on the VM. More details in the NoIP service documentation.\n\n        What is the purpose of assigning a domain name?\n        You can install GitLab on a VM that does not have a domain name. During installation, selfsigned SSL certificates will be automatically issued for connecting to GitLab over HTTPS. However, you will not be able to issue a public SSL certificate for GitLab. As a result, when opening the authorization page of your GitLab server, users will see the warning: “The connection is not secure.”.\n\n\nConnect to the OAUbuntudocker VM via SSH.\nCheck the status of your operating system firewall and disable it if it is active:\n\n        sudo ufw status\n    sudo ufw disable\n\n\n    There is no need for the operating system firewall, since the VK Cloud firewall controls the incoming and outbound traffic on the VM.\n\n\nInstall and configure Docker.\nInstall the Docker Compose plugin:\n\n   Update the list of available Ubuntu packages and their versions:\n\n                sudo aptget update\n\n   Install the latest version of the Docker Compose plugin:\n\n                sudo aptget install dockercomposeplugin\n\n   Verify that the plugin is installed correctly by requesting its version:\n\n                docker compose version\n\n        Expected result:\n\n                Docker Compose version vN.N.N\n\n        Here N.N.N is the plugin version number.\n\n1. Change the port for connecting to the VM via SSH\n\nFor access via SSH, GitLab by default uses port 22, which is reserved by the operating system for connecting to the VM via SSH. To avoid conflict, change the system SSH port to another one.\n\nOpen the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file for editing:\n\n        sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nReplace the line #Port 22 with Port 35242.\n\n\n    The number 35242 is used as an example. If you are going to use a different number, open it for SSH connections in the VM firewall settings. More details in the Managing firewall rules section.\n\n\nSave the file and exit the editor by pressing CTRL+O and then CTRL+X.\n\nRestart the sshd service:\n\n        sudo systemctl restart sshd\n\nClose the current connection to the VM:\n\n        exit\n\nConnect to the OAUbuntudocker VM via SSH using the new port:\n\n        ssh i  ubuntu@185.185.185.185 p 35242\n\n    Instead of 185.185.185.185 you can use the fully qualified domain name of the VM if it exists.\n\n2. Install GitLab and GitLab Runner using Docker Compose\n\nCreate directories for the GitLab persistent repository by sequentially running the commands:\n\n        sudo mkdir p /opt/gitlab\n    sudo mkdir p /opt/gitlab/config\n    sudo mkdir p /opt/gitlab/logs\n    sudo mkdir p /opt/gitlab/data\n    sudo mkdir p /opt/gitlabrunner\n    sudo mkdir p /opt/gitlabrunner/config\n    sudo mkdir p /opt/gitlabrunner/data\n\nCreate and open for editing a Docker Compose configuration file:\n\n        sudo nano dockercompose.yml\n\nCopy the following content into the editor window, replacing 185.185.185.185 with the external IP address of the VM or its fully qualified domain name:\n\n      Content of the dockercompose.yml file\n\n            version: '3.7'\n      services:\n        gitlab:\n          container_name: gitlab\n          image: 'gitlab/gitlabce:latest'\n          restart: always\n          hostname: '185.185.185.185'\n          environment:\n            GITLAB_OMNIBUS_CONFIG: \n              external_url 'https://185.185.185.185'\nAdd any other gitlab.rb configuration parameters here, each on its own line\n          ports:\n            '80:80'\n            '443:443'\n            '22:22'\n          volumes:\n            '/opt/gitlab/config:/etc/gitlab'\n            '/opt/gitlab/logs:/var/log/gitlab'\n            '/opt/gitlab/data:/var/opt/gitlab'\n\n        gitlabrunner:\n          container_name: gitlabrunner\n          image: gitlab/gitlabrunner:latest\n          restart: always\n          volumes:\n            '/opt/gitlabrunner/data:/home/gitlab_ci_multi_runner/data'\n            '/opt/gitlabrunner/config:/etc/gitlabrunner'\n            '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw'\n          environment:\n            CI_SERVER_URLhttps://185.185.185.185/ci\n\n\n    If necessary, specify additional settings below the # Add… comment line.

A cluster can consist of one node or several nodes. For this scenario, one node is enough.\n\nFluentd is a software package responsible for collecting, transforming logs and transferring them for storage. Logstash, a standard component of the ELK stack, has similar functions. However, Fluentd has more options for transferring logs for storage (claimed more than 40 data outputs (https://www.fluentd.org/dataoutputs)), as well as higher speed and low resource requirements (when consuming RAM about 40 megabytes processed 13,000 lines per second). Fluentd is currently used and supported by major companies such as Atlassian, Microsoft, and Amazon. Part of the Fluentd project is Fluentbit, a lightweight log collector/transformer (details read here). In addition, Fluentd, along with projects such as Kubernetes and Prometheus (for details read here (https://www.cncf.io/projects/))), is supported by CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation).\n\nTo run a script:\n\nFrom the ELK stack, we use only Elasticsearch to store the logs that Fluentd will transmit, and Kibana to display them.\nIn the Docker Swarm cluster, we will deploy a simple application from several containers, set up the collection of logs from them, as well as the transfer and visualization of logs to ELK. Let's deploy a Wordpress blog as a test application. To directly pass logs to the Fluentd daemon, we use the Fluentd log driver. By default, logs are written to files that can be read by the Fluentbit daemon, which reduces the chance of logs being lost, since a copy of them is stored in a file. However, using the log driver is more standard practice for Docker Swarm/k8s clusters.\n\nInstalling and configuring Docker Swarm\n\nLogin to the Docker node as root.\nInstall packages:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# aptget install y apttransporthttps cacertificates curl gnupgagent softwarepropertiescommon\n\nAdd the Docker repository key:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# curl fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg  apt key add\nOK\n\nAdd the Docker repository:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# addaptrepository \\\n\"deb archamd64 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu\\\n$(lsb_release cs) \\\nstable\"\n\nInstall Docker:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# aptget update && aptget install y dockerce dockercecli containerd.io\n\nInitialize the cluster:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# docker swarm init\n\nRun Wordpress in a container\n\nCreate a directory /root/wordpress and place the following dockercompose.yml file there:\n\nversion: '3'\n\nnetworks:\nfrontend:\nbackend:\n\nvolumes:\ndb_data: \nwordpress_data: \n\nservices:\ndb:\nimage:mysql:5.7\nvolumes:\ndb_data:/var/lib/mysql\nenvironment:\nMYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD: '1'\nMYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress\nMYSQL_USER: wordpress\nMYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpressPASS\nnetworks:\nbackend\nlogging:\ndriver: \"fluentd\"\noptions:\nfluentdasyncconnect: \"true\"\ntag: \"mysql\"\n\nwordpress:\ndepends_on:\ndb\nimage:wordpress:latest\nvolumes:\nwordpress_data:/var/www/html/wpcontent\nenvironment:\nWORDPRESS_DB_HOST:db:3306\nWORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress\nWORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpressPASS\nWORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress\nnetworks:\nfront end\nbackend\nlogging:\ndriver: \"fluentd\"\noptions:\nfluentdasyncconnect: \"true\"\ntag: \"wordpress\"\n\nnginx:\ndepends_on:\nwordpress\ndb\nimage:nginx:latest\nvolumes:\n./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf\nports:\n80:80\nnetworks:\nfront end\nlogging:\ndriver: \"fluentd\"\noptions:\nfluentdasyncconnect: \"true\"\ntag: \"nginx\"\n\n\n\n\nAttention\n\nchange wordpressPASS to a random password.\n\n\n\nFor each container, the Fluentd log driver is described, the background connection to the Fluentd collector is indicated, and additional tags are affixed for further processing (if necessary).\n\nPlace the nginx.conf configuration file in the /root/wordpress directory:\n\nevents \n\n\n\nhttp \nclient_max_body_size 20m;\nproxy_cache_path /etc/nginx/cache keys_zoneone:32m max_size64m;\nserver \nserver_name_default;\nlisten 80;\nproxy_cache one;\nlocation / \nproxy_pass http://wordpress:80;\nproxy_set_header Host $http_host;\nproxy_set_header XForwardedHost $http_host;\nproxy_set_header XRealIP $remote_addr;\nproxy_set_header XForwardedFor $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\nproxy_set_header XForwardedProto $scheme;\n\n\n\n\nRun containers:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# docker stack deploy c /root/wordpress/dockercompose.yml blog\nCreating network blog_backend\nCreating network blog_frontend\nCreating service blog_wordpress\nCreating service blog_nginx\nCreating service blog_db\n\nMake sure everything started successfully:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# docker service ls\nID .

It consists of several sections, consider them.\n\nSource section \\ contains a description of the source of the logs. The Docker Fluentd log driver sends logs to tcp://localhost:24224 by default. Let's describe the source section for receiving logs:\n\n\n@type forward\nport 24224\n\n\n@type forward means the fluentd protocol that runs over a TCP connection and is used by Docker to send logs to the Fluentd daemon.\n\nData output section in elasticsearch:\n\n@type elasticsearch\nhost\nport 9200\nlogstash_format true\n\n\nIn , specify the DNS name or IP address of the Elasticsearch server.\n\nSuch a configuration file is the minimum for sending logs to Elasticsearh, but fluentd's capabilities are not limited to this. It has extensive filtering, parsing and data formatting capabilities.\n\nA typical example of filtering is setting up a selection by regexp:\n\n\n@type grep\n\nkey message\npattern /cool/\n\n\nkey hostname\npattern /^web\\d+\\.example\\.com$/\n\n\nkey message\npattern /uncool/\n\n\n\nThis example will select records from the stream that contain the word cool in the message field, the hostname field, for example, www123.example.com, and do not contain the word uncool in the tag field. The following data will be verified:\n\n\"message\":\"It's cool outside today\", \"hostname\":\"web001.example.com\"\n\"message\":\"That's not cool\", \"hostname\":\"web1337.example.com\"\n\nThe following are not:\n\n\"message\":\"I am cool but you are uncool\", \"hostname\":\"db001.example.com\"\n\"hostname\":\"web001.example.com\"\n\"message\":\"It's cool outside today\"\n\nThis example is taken from the fluentd manual. Another good example of using a filter is adding geodata.\n\nParsers are designed to parse logs of a standard structure (for example, Nginx logs). Parsers are specified in the source section:\n\n\n@typetail\npath /path/to/input/file\n\n@type nginx\nkeep_time_key true\n\n\n\nThis is a typical example of parsing Nginx logs. Data formatting is used to change the format or structure of output data and is described in the output section.\n\nThe possibilities of fluentd are very wide, their description is beyond the scope of this article. To learn more about fluentd, see the documentation.\n\nView logs\n\nWhen entering Elasticsearch, the logs will be added to the logstashYYYYMMDD index. If you need more complex processing of logs, you can send the logs not directly to Elasticsearch, but to Logstash, and parse and arrange them there.\n\nTo view logs:\n\nIn a browser, go to the Kibana web console, then click on the Management / Index patterns link.\n\n\n\nIn the Index Pattern input window, enter logstash\\* and click Next Step.\n\n\n\nIn the Time filter field name window, select @timestamp and click Create index pattern:\n\n\n\nIndex pattern created.\n\n\n\nGo to Discover, select an index. There will be container logs:\n\n\n\nNext, try creating a couple of test posts in Wordpress and look in Kibana for changes in the logs.\n","url":"/en/cases/cases-logs/case-swarm","categoryPartialPath":"/en/cases","description":"","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"How-to guides","link":"/en/cases","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Logging","link":"/en/cases/cases-logs","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"d2e2c045-1b01-46a5-b488-399f3f58f0b4","title":"Installing the ELK Stack on Ubuntu 18.04","data":"This article describes the installation of the ELK stack on a Linux operating system — Ubuntu 18.04.\n\nThe ELK stack is a powerful set of tools for efficiently solving a wide range of data collection, storage and analysis tasks:\n\nElasticsearch is a full text search solution built on top of Apache Lucene with added convenience.\nLogstash is a utility for collecting, filtering and then redirecting to the final data storage.

For this:\n\n   Create the 30elasticsearchoutput.conf file by running the command:\n\n            sudo nano /etc/logstash/conf.d/30elasticsearchoutput.conf\n\n   Add the following lines to this file:\n\n            output \n      elasticsearch \n      hosts > \"localhost:9200\"\n      sniffing > true\n      manage_template > false\n      template_overwrite > true\n      index > \"%@metadata%+YYYY.MM.dd\"\n      document_type > \"%@metadata\"\n      \n      \n\n   Save your changes using the CTRL+O key combination and finish editing using the CTRL+X key combination.\n\nCreate a file containing rules for filtering and structuring incoming data. For this:\n\n   Create the file 10systemfilter.conf by running the command:\n\n            sudo nano /etc/logstash/conf.d/10logstashfilter.conf\n\n   In the file that opens, place the following lines:\n\n            input  stdin   \n      filter \n      grok \n         match >  \"message\" > \"%COMBINEDAPACHELOG\" \n      \n      date \n         match >  \"timestamp\" , \"dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z\" \n      \n      \n      output \n      elasticsearch  hosts > \"localhost:9200\" \n      stdout  codec > rubydebug \n      \n\n   Save your changes using the CTRL+O key combination and finish editing using the CTRL+X key combination.\n\nCheck the Logstash configuration by running the command:\n            sudo u logstash /usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash path.settings /etc/logstash t\n\nStart Logstash by running the command:\n\n      sudo systemctl start logstash\n\nTo start the Logstash service automatically when the operating system is rebooted, run the command:\n\n      sudo systemctl enable logstash\n\nInstalling and configuring Filebeat\n\nFilebeat allows you to collect data (beats) from various sources and transfer them to Logstash or Elasticsearch on Linuxlike systems.\n\nTo install Filebeat:\n\nOpen a terminal.\n\nInstall Filebeat by running the command:\n\n      sudo apt install filebeat\n\nSet up the filebeat.yml configuration file. For this:\n\n   Open this file:\n\n            sudo nano /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml\n\n   Prevent Filebeat from sending data directly to Elasticsearch. To do this, find the lines:\n\n            output.elasticsearch:\nArray of hosts to connect to.\n      hosts: \"localhost:9200\"\n\n      And replace them with the lines:\n\n                  #output.elasticsearch:\nArray of hosts to connect to.\n         #hosts: \"localhost:9200\"\n\n   Tell the Filebeat service to use Logstash as a log collector. To do this, find the lines:\n\n            #output.logstash:\nThe Logstash hosts\n      #hosts: \"localhost:5044\"\n\n      And replace them with the lines:\n\n                  output.logstash:\nThe Logstash hosts\n         hosts: \"localhost:5044\"\n\n         Save your changes using the CTRL+O key combination and finish editing using the CTRL+X key combination.\n\nEnable the Logstash module. To do this, run the command:\n\n      sudo sudo filebeat modules enable logstash\n\n\n   Note\n\n   Learn more about filebeat modules read here.\n\n\nTo view the included modules, run the command:\n\n      sudo filebeat modules list\n\nDownload the Elasticsearch index template by running the command:\n\n      sudo filebeat setup template E output.logstash.enabledfalse E 'output.elasticsearch.hosts\"localhost:9200\"'\n\n\n   Note\n\n   Elasticsearch indexes are a collection of documents that have similar characteristics. They are identified by names that are used to refer to indexes when performing various index operations. The index template is loaded automatically when new indexes are created.\n\n\nDashboards allow you to visualize the Filebeat data sent to Kibana. To enable the dashboard, run the command:\n\n      sudo filebeat setup e E output.logstash.enabledfalse E output.elasticsearch.hosts'localhost:9200' E setup.kibana.hostlocalhost:5601\n\nStart Filebeat by running the command:\n\n      sudo systemctl start filebeat\n\nTo start the filebeat service automatically when the operating system is rebooted, run the command:\n\n      sudo systemctl enable filebeat\n\nTo verify that Elasticsearch is receiving data, query the Filebeat index with the command:\n\n      curl XGET 'http://localhost:9200/filebeat\\*/_search?pretty'\n\nThe installation of the ELK stack is complete.\n\nIn the address bar of your web browser, enter the IP address of your Elastic server.

For Elasticsearch, this parameter directly affects how large data arrays it can process. Heap Size is determined by a couple of parameters:\n\nXms — initial value;\nXmx — maximum value.\n\nThe default Heap Size is 1 GB. If the amount of memory on the server allows, increase this value (more about Heap Size). To do this, find the lines:\n\nXms1g\nXmx1g\n\nand replace them, for example, with the lines:\n\nXms4g\nxmx4g\n\nlog4j2.properties\n\nFor convenience, you can change appender.rolling.policies.size.size, which specifies the size of the log at which rotation is performed (default is 128 MB).

Also, if Elasticsearch is not on the same host as Kibana, change the elasticsearch.hosts setting: \"http://localhost:9200\".\n\nStart Kibana:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:/etc/kibana# systemctl start kibana.service\n\nAdd Kibana to the list of applications that start automatically:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:/etc/kibana# systemctl enable kibana.service\nSynchronizing state of kibana.service with SysV service script with /lib/systemd/systemdsysvinstall.\nExecuting: /lib/systemd/systemdsysvinstall enable kibana\n\nIn a browser, navigate to http://:5601.\n\nIf Kibana is running, the following will be displayed:\n\nConfiguring Kibana and Elasticsearch Security\n\nBy default, Elasticsearch and Kibana are fully accessible to everyone. Access can be restricted in one of the following ways:\n\nUse Nginx as a reverse proxy with authorization and access control.\nUse the builtin elasticsearch mechanism xpack.security (for details see here or here).\n\nConsider the most popular first method.\n\nInstall Nginx:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# aptget install nginx\n\nMake sure that in the configuration file /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml the network.host parameter is set to 127.0.0.1 or localhost. If necessary, make this configuration and restart the elasticsearch daemon:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# cat /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml  grep network.host\nnetwork.host: 127.0.0.1\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# systemctl restart elasticsearch.service\n\nMake sure that the server.host parameter in the configuration file /etc/kibana/kibana.yml is set to 127.0.0.1 or localhost. If necessary, make this configuration and restart the kibana daemon:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# cat /etc/kibana/kibana.yml  grep server.host\nserver.host: \"127.0.0.1\"\nWhen this setting's value is true Kibana uses the hostname specified in the server.host\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# systemctl restart kibana.service\n\nMake sure Elasticsearh and Kibana are using interface 127.0.0.1:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# netstat tulpn  grep9200\ntcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:9200 :::\\* LISTEN 10512/java\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# netstat tulpn  grep 5601\ntcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:5601 0.0.0.0:\\* LISTEN 11029/node\n\nIn /etc/nginx/sitesavailable create a kibana.conf file and add the following to it:\n\nserver \nlisten :5601;\nserver_name kibana;\nerror_log /var/log/nginx/kibana.error.log;\naccess_log /var/log/nginx/kibana.access.log;\n\nlocation / \nauth_basic \"Restricted Access\";\nauth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/htpasswd;\nrewrite ^/(.\\*) /$1 break;\nproxy_ignore_client_abort on;\nproxy_pass http://localhost:5601;\nproxy_set_header XRealIP $remote_addr;\nproxy_set_header XForwardedFor $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\nproxy_set_header Host $http_host;\n\n\n\nSpecify the username (USER) and password (PASSWORD):\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:/etc/nginx# printf \"USER:$(openssl passwd crypt PASSWORD)\\n\" >> /etc/nginx/htpasswd\n\nTo enable the site, create a symlink to the /etc/nginx/sitesenabled directory:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# ln s /etc/nginx/sitesavailable/kibana.conf /etc/nginx/sitesenabled/kibana.conf\n\nStart Nginx:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# systemctl start nginx\n\nIn a browser, navigate to http://:5601. In the window that opens, enter your login and password to access the Kibana web interface.\n\nSimilarly configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for Elasticsearh (port 9200) and Logstash (typically port 5044).\n\nTo get familiar with Kibana, you can use the test dataset:\n\nInstall Filebeat\n\nBeats is part of the Elasticsearch infrastructure, the socalled Data Shippers (data providers). These are lightweight agents that take data from various sources and transform it for transmission to Elasticsearch. The functionality of Beats partially duplicates Logstash, but Beats is lighter, easier to set up, works faster and does not require the Java stack to be installed. Typically, the nodes where the logs are generated have the appropriate Beats agents installed, which transfer the logs to Logstash. Logstash aggregates, transforms logs and passes them to Elasticsearch. There are many different Beats, the standard set includes the following agents:\n\nFilebeat — collection of logs from various log files.\nPacketbeat — collection of network statistics.\nWinlogbeat — collection of logs on the Windows platform.\nMetricbeat — collection of various metrics.\nHeartbeat — collection of data on infrastructure availability.\nAuditbeat — collection of system audit data.\nFunctionbeat — data collection from Serverless projects (AWS Lambda).\nJournalbeat — collection of Journald logs.\n\nThe most common agent is Filebeat, we use it to collect Nginx logs.\n\nInstall Filebeat:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# aptget install filebeat\n\nAllow Nginx log processing:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# mv /etc/filebeat/modules.d/nginx.yml.disabled /etc/filebeat/modules.d/nginx.yml\n\nIf the logs are in a nonstandard location, or only part of the logs needs to be processed, uncomment and fill in the var.paths variables in the /etc/filebeat/modules.d/nginx.yml file.\n\nIn the example below, we will collect and analyze logs for accessing the Kibana service. When configuring Nginx, we specified that access logs would be stored in the /var/log/nginx/kibana.access.log and /var/log/nginx/kibana.error.log files.\n\nMake the /etc/filebeat/modules.d/nginx.yml file look like this:\n\nModule: nginx\nDocs: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/7.4/filebeatmodulenginx.html\nmodule: nginx\nAccess logs\naccess:\nenabled: true\n\nSet custom paths for the log files. if left empty,\nFilebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.\nvar paths:\n/var/log/nginx/kibana.access.log\n\nError logs\nerror:\nenabled: true\n\nSet custom paths for the log files. if left empty,\nFilebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.\nvar paths:\n/var/log/nginx/kibana.error.log\n\nIn the /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml file, edit the setup.kibana section:\n\nsetup.kibana:\n  host: \":5601\"\n  username: \"login\"\n  password: \"password\"\n\n\n\nNote\n\nLogin and password are required for Filebeat access to Kibana in order to load typical dashboards for known datasets.\n\n\n\nThe logs will be sent to Logstash, so comment out the output.elasticsearch section and specify the IP address of the server hosting Logstash in the output.logstash section:\n\n# Elasticsearch output  \n#output.elasticsearch:\nArray of hosts to connect to.\nhosts: \"localhost:9200\"\n\nOptional protocol and basic auth credentials.\n#protocol: \"https\"\n#username: \"elastic\"\n#password: \"changeme\"\n\n# Logstash output  \noutput.logstash:\nThe Logstash hosts\nhosts: \":5044\"\n\nOptional SSL. By default is off.\nList of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications\n#ssl.certificate_authorities: \"/etc/pki/root/ca.pem\"\n\nCertificate for SSL client authentication\n#ssl.certificate: \"/etc/pki/client/cert.pem\"\n\nClient Certificate Key\n  #ssl.key: \"/etc/pki/client/cert.key\"\n\nMake sure there are no errors in the configuration file:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:/etc/filebeat# filebeat test config c /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml\nconfig OK\n\nBefore starting Filebeat, configure Logstash to accept logs.\n\nSetting up Logstash\n\nThe Logstash configuration file generally consists of three sections:\n\ninput — description of the destination of the logs.\nfilter — transformation of logs.\noutput — description of the destination of the converted logs.\n\nCreate a file /etc/logstash/conf.d/inputbeats.conf containing the port number on which Beats (in particular, Filebeat) sends its logs:\n\ninput \nbeat \nport > 5044\n\n\n\nCreate the /etc/logstash/conf.d/outputelasticsearch.conf file and specify that logs should be sent to Elasticsearch at localhost and indexes should be named in the nginx format (that is, a new index will be created every day , which is convenient for analysis):\n\noutput \nelasticsearch \nhosts >  \"localhost:9200\" \nmanage_template > false\nindex > \"nginx%+YYYY.MM.dd\"\n\n\n\nCreate a file /etc/logstash/conf.d/filternginx.conf with the following content:\n\nfilter \nif event  ​​\"nginx.access\" \ngrok \nmatch >  \"message\" , \"%IPORHOST:clientip %USER:ident %USER:auth \\%HTTPDATE:timestamp\\ \\\"(?:%WORD:verb % NOTSPACE:request(?: HTTP/%NUMBER:httpversion)?%DATA:rawrequest)\\\" %NUMBER:response (?:%NUMBER:bytes) %QS:referrer  %QS:user_agent\"\noverwrite >  \"message\" \n\nmutate \nconvert > \"response\", \"integer\"\nconvert > \"bytes\", \"integer\"\nconvert > \"responsetime\", \"float\"\n\ngeoip \nsource > \"clientip\"\ntarget > \"geoip\"\nadd_tag ​​> \"nginxgeoip\"\n\ndate \nmatch >  \"timestamp\" , \"dd/MMM/YYYY:HH:mm:ss Z\" \nremove_field >  \"timestamp\" \n\n\nuseragent \nsource > \"user_agent\"\n\n\n\nFilebeat, which will send Nginx logs to Logstash, writes the entire Nginx log line in the message field. Therefore, this field needs to be parsed into variables that can be worked with in Elasticsearch. This parsing is done in the grok section of the NGINX ACCESS LOG format.\n\nIn the mutate section, you can change the data storage format (for example, so that the bytes field from the log is stored as a number, not as a string).\n\nIn the geoip section, geolocation fields are added to the log by the request IP address.\n\nThe date section is used to parse the query date field from the log and convert it to pass it to Elasticsearch.\n\nThe useragent section fills in the fields according to the field from the log. Note that the agent field is usually used in these tutorials. This field will not work with Filebeat + Logstash as it is intended to be used when writing directly from Filebeat to Elasticsearh. When used in Logstash, an error will be thrown:\n\n20191119T09:55:46,254logstash.filters.useragent Uknown error while parsing user agent data :exception>#, :field>\"agent\", :event>#\n\nFor the same reason, you don't need to use the %COMBINEDAPACHELOG macro in the grok match section.\n\nTo track errors in Logstash, enable debugging. To do this, add the following line to the output section:\n\nstdout  codec > rubydebug \n\nAs a result, the output to the Elasticsearch database will be duplicated by the output to the console/syslog. It is also useful to use the Grok Debugger to test grok match expressions.\n\nLaunch Logstash and add it to the list of applications to start automatically:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# systemctl start logstash\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# systemctl enable logstash\nCreated symlink /etc/systemd/system/multiuser.target.wants/logstash.service → /etc/systemd/system/logstash.service.\n\nMake sure the service has started:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# netstat tulpn  grep5044\ntcp6 0 0 :::5044 :::\\* LISTEN 18857/java\n\nTest Filebeat:\n\nroot@ubuntustd11:~# service filebeat start\n\nSet up Kibana Templates\n\nAfter starting Filebeat, Kibana access logs go to Logstash, then to Elasticsearch. To view these logs, Kibana needs to configure templates.\n\nGo to Kibana, click the gear in the left menu, select Kibana > Index Patterns and click Create Index Pattern.\n\n\n\nTo select all entries, enter nginx\\* in the Index pattern field and click Next step.\n\n\n\nTo use timestamps from log files, select @timestamp in the Time Filter field name and click Create index pattern.\n\n\n\nAn index pattern will be created.\n\n\n\nTo see the logs that got into Elasticsearch, go to Discover.\n\nSet up Kibana Visualizations\n\nThe dashboard in Kibana is made up of visualizations. A visualization is a kind of graph built on specific queries from Elasticsearch.\n\nLet's build the first visualization  top 10 clients.\n\nSelect Visualizations from the left menu and click the Create new visualization button.\n\n\n\nSelect Vertical bar.\n\n\n\nSelect the nginx\\* template.\n\n\n\nAdd an X axis.\n\n\n\nEnter data:\n\nAggregation: Terms — returns the specified number of top values.\nField: clientip.keyword — select a client by IP address.\nSize: 10 — 10 top values.\nCustom Label: Top 10 clients — the name of the visualization.\n\n\n\nRun the query and save the visualization.\n\n\n\nAs a result, the visualization shows the top 10 IP addresses from which requests were made.\n\nLet's build a second visualization  a pie chart showing the top 5 countries from which users contacted.\n\nSelect Visualizations from the left menu and click the Create new visualization button.\nSelect Pie.\nSelect the nginx\\* template.\nAdd an X axis.\nTo display data in slices, select Add bucket / Split slices.\n\n\n\nEnter the following data:\n\nAggregation: Terms — select the top data value.\nField: geoip.country_code2.keyword — twoletter country code.\nSize:5 — select top 5.\nCustom label: Top 5 countries — chart title.\n\n\n\nRun the query and save the visualization.\n\n\n\nThe graph will display the top 5 countries from which there was access.\n\nLet's build the third visualization  a graph of the number of requests, divided by response codes.\n\nSelect Visualizations from the left menu and click the Create new visualization button.\nSelect TSVB.\nSelect the nginx\\* template.\nTo get all server response codes (that is, all requests sent to the server), in the window that appears, enter Requests in the name, select group by filter, and specify response:\\* in the query string.\nTo add a second line to the chart, .\nTo get a sample of the number of server responses \"200 OK\" per unit of time on the second chart, click \"+\", select a different color, specify Responce:200 in the title, response:200 in the query string.\nClick \"+\" and add the 302 response code in the same way. Then save the visualization.\n\nKibana Dashboard setup\n\nKibana Dashboard is a set of visualizations.\n\nClick Dashboards, then Create New Dashboard.\n\n\n\nOn the top menu, click Add.\n\n\n\nIn the window that opens, select the visualizations you created.\n\n\n\nReorder and resize the visualizations as needed, then click Save.\n\n\n","url":"/en/cases/cases-logs/case-logging","categoryPartialPath":"/en/cases","description":"","tags":"","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Documentation","link":"/en","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"How-to guides","link":"/en/cases","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true},{"title":"Logging","link":"/en/cases/cases-logs","isActive":false,"evenSimpler":true}]},{"uuid":"4300e020-2d5f-47c2-838c-c49d1c863152","title":"Collecting logs from nodes with docker-runtime and crio-runtime using Fluent Bit","data":"To unify the collection of logs from nodes with dockerruntime and crioruntime, you should use Fluent Bit (a lightweight and more performant alternative to fluentd).\n\nSettings file values.yaml\n\nAs values.yaml for the Helm, you should use the file from the link below  the necessary filters and parsers are already configured in it.\n\nFile values.yaml.\n\nIn the attached values.yaml, you need to correct the parameters for OUTPUT  in the example, PostgreSQL is used for storing logs with two tables in one database:\n\nTable fluentbit_21_host  for storing logs of host services (kublet.service, docker.service, crio.service).\nTable fluentbit_21_kube  stores logs directly from pod logs.\n\nIn a similar way, logs can be saved, for example, in Elasticsearch.

When the docker container is restarted, data, including application logs, is deleted;\nlogs cannot be rotated in a container since rotation is an additional process in addition to the logged one, and more than one process cannot be started in one container.\n\n\n\nLog rotation is the process of processing, cleaning, archiving, and sending logs using utilities.\n\n\n\nTo access the logs of containerized applications in Kubernetes, Docker containers must transfer their logs to standard output streams (stdout) and errors (stderr). By default, Docker logging driver writes logs to a JSON file on the node, from where they can be obtained using the command:\n\nkubectl logs pod_name\n\n\n\nDocker logging driver is a log collection mechanism built into the Docker engine and supports many log rotation tools.\n\n\n\nWhen the Kubernetes orchestrator manages the lifecycle of Docker containers, pods with containers are often and unpredictably created, reloaded and deleted. If the settings of the Docker logging driver allow this, you can access the last logs of the pod before the reboot using the previous argument:\n\nkubectl logs pod_name previous\n\nBut it is impossible to get logs for more than one reboot back in this way. Deleting a pod means deleting all information about it, including logs.\n\nTherefore, to work with application logs in Kubernetes, a system is needed to collect, aggregate, save and extract useful information from logs. A bundle of Elasticsearch search engine, Fluentd logging agent, and Kibana — EFKstack dashboard is suitable for this task.\n\nThe scheme of the logging system in the Kubernetes cluster:\n\nThe scheme of the logging system in the Kubernetes clusterparamswidth70%; height70%; noBordertrue\n\nDepending on the amount of information required in Elasticsearch processing, you can choose different ways to install the EFK stack:\n\nWith expected loads of tens of thousands of logs per second, installing Elasticsearch in a Kubernetes cluster is not recommended. For a highly loaded solution in production, it is better to allocate separate virtual machines for the Elasticsearch cluster itself and send logs from Kubernetes using log aggregators.\nIf the system does not produce tens of thousands of logs, and you need to monitor the logs on dev, test environments, the EFK stack can be installed in the Kubernetes cluster, closer to the applications.\n\nAs an agent of the log collector, we use fluentd, an application for collecting, filtering, and aggregating logs, written in C and Ruby languages and with various plugins to expand the application's basic functionality.\n\nWe organize a centralized logging system for Kubernetes.\n\nInstalling Elasticsearch in Kubernetes using helm\n\nCreate namespace kubelogging:\n\nkubectl create ns kubelogging\n\n\n\nWhen installing from helm, you will need to set the storageclass for the application.\n\n\n\nFind out the storage class available in the Kubernetes cluster:\n\nadmin@k8s:~$ kubectl get sc \nNAME            PROVISIONER            AGE\nhdd (default)   kubernetes.io/cinder   103d\nhddretain      kubernetes.io/cinder   103d\nssd             kubernetes.io/cinder   103d\nssdretain      kubernetes.io/cinder   103d\n\nInstall Elasticsearch in the Kubernetes cluster with the specified variables:\n\n      helm install stable/elasticsearch \\\n         name elastic \\\n         set client.replicas1 \\\n         set master.replicas1 \\\n         set data.replicas1 \\\n         set master.persistence.storageClasshdd \\\n         set data.persistence.storageClasshdd \\\n         set master.podDisruptionBudget.minAvailable1 \\\n         set resources.requests.memory4Gi \\\n         set cluster.env.MINIMUM_MASTER_NODES1 \\\n         set cluster.env.RECOVER_AFTER_MASTER_NODES1 \\\n         set cluster.env.EXPECTED_MASTER_NODES1 \\\n         namespace kubelogging\n\n   As a result, an Elasticsearch cluster will be installed, consisting of one master node, one data storage node, and one client node.\nMake sure that all the pods are ready to work:\n\n      kubectl get po n kubelogging\n\n      NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\n   elasticelasticsearchclientc745987979m7pm   1/1     Running  \n   elasticelasticsearchdata0                   1/1     Running  \n   elasticelasticsearchmaster0                 1/1     Running\nFind out the name of the services in kubelogging:\n\n      kubectl get svc n kubelogging\n\n      NAME                              TYPE        CLUSTERIP     EXTERNALIP   PORT(S)    AGE\n   elasticelasticsearchclient      ClusterIP   10.233.8.213           9200/TCP   11m\n   elasticelasticsearchdiscovery   ClusterIP   None                   9300/TCP   11m\n\nThe elasticelasticsearchclient service will be used for linking with kibana and fluentd.
