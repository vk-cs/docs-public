If a trigger fires more than 100 times within 24 hours, the trigger will automatically turn off. You will receive a notification email with recommendations.

There are several reasons why the trigger fires so often:

1. The trigger is not configured correctly. Read about how to configure it [here](/ru/manage/alerting/triggers/trigger-edit "change-lang").
2. There are problems that need to be fixed.

We recommend that you check the trigger settings and make sure that any issues are resolved. To run a trigger, click on "..." in the trigger line -> "Enable".
