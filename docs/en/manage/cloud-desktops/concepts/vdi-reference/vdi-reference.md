Basic concepts of the Cloud Desktop service:

- **Desktop** — a virtual workplace with software installed on it. The desktop is created within the desktop pool and is assigned by the service administrator.
- **Desktop pool** — combining multiple desktops that use shared computing resources. Through the desktop pool, you can set general settings for desktops. Desktops in this pool can be created from different templates depending on the tasks being performed.
- **Desktop template** — template for creating VMs and desktops. For the desktop OS of such a template, the virtualization service component must be installed and configured.
- **Directory service** is a software package designed for hierarchical storage, organization and provision of access to information. Interaction with such services is carried out through protocols, the most common is LDAP. The Cloud Desktop service supports integration with Active Directory (AD) and OpenLDAP directory services.
