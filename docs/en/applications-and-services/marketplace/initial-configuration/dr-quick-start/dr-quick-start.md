You can set up data recovery and IT infrastructure in case of unforeseen circumstances using the service [Hystax Acura Disaster Recovery](https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/en/services/marketplace/v2/apps/service/440568b5-e418-431f-9d43-e54eb20ee05a/latest/info/) without suspending applications. Using the service allows you to optimize the indicators:

- Recovery Point Objective (RPO) — the time between the creation of the last backup and the moment of the accident. It can be configured individually for each resource.
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO) — the time between the response to an accident and the restoration of infrastructure. The service allows you to minimize this indicator.

<details>
  <summary>How the service works</summary>

1. Agents are installed on target VMs to synchronize with Hystax Acura.
1. Data replication is performed for synchronized VMs. If necessary, the VM backup schedule is configured.
1. A disaster recovery plan is created: a description of the infrastructure and a set of instructions for recreating a business application in the VK Cloud. It is possible to create several plans. To reduce the RPO value, disaster recovery plans must be kept up to date.
1. A backup infrastructure is created based on the plan.
1. In case of emergency situations, the backup infrastructure takes over the entire load.

</details>

After completing all the steps of a instruction, you will:

1. Deploy the Cloud Disaster Recovery service in VK Cloud.
1. Install the agent on the VM and perform data replication for it.
1. Create a backup infrastructure using a backup recovery plan.
1. Restore the reserved infrastructure in VK Cloud.

By using the Hystax Acura Disaster Recovery service, you agree to the license agreements of [Marketplace](/ru/intro/start/legal/marketplace "change-lang") and [Hystax Acura Disaster Recovery](https://хст.рф/terms-of-use/).

## Preparatory steps

1. [Register](/en/intro/start/account-registration) at VK Cloud.
1. [Configure](/en/tools-for-using-services/account/service-management/account-manage/manage-2fa) two-factor authentication (2FA) for the account on whose behalf the restored infrastructure will be deployed.
1. [Create a VM](/en/base/iaas/service-management/vm/vm-create) for which recovery will be applied. As part of the quick start, the `Ubuntu-DR` VM with the Ubuntu 18.04 operating system will be used.
1. [Connect](../../service-management/pr-instance-add/) Hystax Acura Disaster Recovery service.

   Wait for the installation to complete — a link with a username and password will be sent to your email. The service will be deployed at https://dr.mcs-cloud.ru (Hystax Acura personal account).

## 2. Make data replication

1. Log in to Hystax Acura [personal account](https://dr.mcs-cloud.ru) using the received username and password.
1. Click the **Install replication agents** button.
1. In the “Agent selection” step, select **Linux** and click **Next**.
1. At the “Agent settings” step, specify the parameters:

   - **Machines group**: `Default`.
   - **Select target Linux distribution**: `Debian/Ubuntu (.deb package)`.
   - **Snapshot driver deployment type**: `DKMS`.

1. Click the **Next** button.
1. Install the agent on the target VM, following the instructions for the Ubuntu distribution.

   After installing the VM agent, `Ubuntu-DR` will appear on the main page of Hystax Acura [personal account](https://dr.mcs-cloud.ru) with **Unprotected** status.

1. Expand the `Ubuntu-DR` VM menu in the **Machines Groups** list and select the **Edit Replication schedule** option. In the window that opens, specify the parameters:

   - **Use custom Replication schedule settings**: select an option.
   - **Volume availability zone**: `MS1`.
   - **Volume type**: `CEPH-HDD`.

   <info>

   For more information about replication and creating a backup schedule, see [Hystax official documentation](https://hystax.com/documentation/dr/dr_overview.html#edit-replication-settings-schedule).

   </info>

1. Click the **Save** button.
1. Open the `Ubuntu-DR` VM menu and select the **Start Protection** option.
1. Wait for the operation to complete — the VM status will change to **Protected**.

## 3. Create a disaster recovery plan

1. Click the **Create DR plan** button.
1. In the **Name** field, specify the name of the plan `DR-plan`.
1. Go to the **Expert** tab and click **Generate DR plan from all machines** button.

   - **Cloud name**: `VK Cloud`.
   - **Keystone API endpoint**: Keystone value from [endpoints list](https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/mcs3723876490/project/endpoints), `https://infra.mail.ru:35357/v3/` for VK Cloud.
   - **User domain**: value **User Domain Name** of [project settings](https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/project/keys).
   - **Username**: user name with [API access](/en/tools-for-using-services/rest-api/enable-api) and a role not lower than the Project administrator.
   - **Password**: the user's password.

   - **Target project ID**: value **Project ID** of [project settings](https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/project/keys)
   - **Hystax Service Network**: The UUID of the network to which the VM will be deployed.
   - **Floating IP Network**: external network `ext-net`.

1. Click the **Next** button.
1. At the “Select resource” step, select `VK-Cloud-infra` from the list **From Cloud Site**.
1. Click the **Next** button.
1. At the “Failback settings” step, specify the name of the structure being restored.
1. Click the **Start Failback** button.

   The infrastructure in VK Cloud will be brought to the state corresponding to 'VK-Cloud-infra'.

## 6. Check the functionality of the restored VM

Find the restored VM in VK Cloud (`<project ID>_cloud_agent`), [perform](/en/base/iaas/service-management/vm/vm-manage) arbitrary operations on it.

## Delete unused resources

Running VMs consume computing resources. If you don't need them anymore:

- [Delete](/en/base/iaas/service-management/vm/vm-manage#deleting_a_vm) `Ubuntu-DR` VM.
- Delete the backup infrastructure `VK-Cloud-infra` via Hystax Acura [personal account](https://dr.mcs-cloud.ru).
- [Delete](/en/networks/vnet/service-management/floating-ip#removing_floating_ip_address_from_the_project) floating IP address if it was created during recovery.
