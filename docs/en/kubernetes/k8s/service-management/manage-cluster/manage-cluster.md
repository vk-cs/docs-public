## Get cluster information

Different information is available for running and stopped clusters. Terraform allows you to get only part of the information about the cluster.

<tabs>
<tablist>
<tab>Personal account</tab>
<tab>Terraform</tab>
</tablist>
<tabpanel>

1. Go to [VK Cloud personal account](https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/).
1. Select the project where the necessary cluster is located.
1. Go to **Containers** → **Kubernetes Clusters**.
1. Click on the name of the necessary cluster. A page with information will open.

   General information about the cluster and the event log are available on the corresponding tab at the beginning of the page. Information about connecting to and managing the cluster is available on the corresponding tab at the end of the page.

</tabpanel>
<tabpanel>

1. Run the command:

   ```bash
   terraform state show vkcs_kubernetes_cluster.<cluster resource name in the Terraform configuration file>
   ```

1. Examine the available information in the output of the command.

</tabpanel>
</tabs>

## Get props for connecting to the cluster

Available props:

- `kubectl` configuration file;
- Kubernetes Dashboard secret (it can only be obtained when the cluster is running).

The operations to get these props are described in detail in [Connecting](../../connect/) section.

## Invalidate cluster key pair

When creating clusters of versions 1.22.9 and lower, you can specify a key pair to connect to the cluster hosts directly.

If the private part of the specified key pair has been compromised or lost, you can revoke the cluster key pair by performing the invalidate procedure.

The operation can only be performed when the cluster is running.

<warn>

After performing this operation, the existing public keys on the cluster will be removed.

## Change virtual machine type for master nodes

This operation is described in detail in [Cluster node scaling](../scale/).

## Delete cluster

<tabs>
<tablist>
<tab>Personal account</tab>
