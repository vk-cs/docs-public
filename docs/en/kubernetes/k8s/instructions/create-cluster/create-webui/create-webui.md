The following describes how to create a first-generation cluster from your management console. We recommend [creating](/en/kubernetes/k8s/instructions/create-cluster/create-webui-gen-2) second-generation clusters: they feature improved performance and stability. 

You can also create a first-generation cluster [with Terraform](../create-terraform).

{note:warn}

When installing a cluster, a [service load balancer](/en/networks/balancing/concepts/load-balancer#types_of_load_balancers) will be created. Usage of this load balancer is [charged](/en/networks/vnet/tariffication).

{/note}

## Before you create a cluster

1. Review the available resources and [quotas](/en/tools-for-using-services/account/concepts/quotasandlimits#k8s) for the [region](/en/tools-for-using-services/account/concepts/regions) where you want to create the cluster. Different quotas may be configured for different regions.

   If you want to increase the quotas, contact [technical support](mailto:support@mcs.mail.ru).

1. Run the cluster creation wizard:

   1. Go to [VK Cloud management console](https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/).
   1. Select the [project](../../../../../tools-for-using-services/account/concepts/projects) to place the cluster in.
   1. Go to **Containers** â†’ **Kubernetes clusters**.
   1. Click the **Add** button or **Create cluster** button, if there are no clusters in the selected project.
   1. Select the **Generation 1** option and click the **Continue** button.

## 1. Configure the cluster

1. Specify the cluster settings:

   - **Cluster name**: must start with a letter. It can only contain lowercase Latin letters, numbers, and hyphens `-` as a separator.

   - **Cluster type**:

     - **Standard**: all cluster master nodes will be located in one [availability zone](/en/intro/start/concepts/architecture#az). High availability is provided at the zone level.
     - **Regional**: cluster master nodes will be located in each of the three availability zones, which allows maintaining control even if one of the zones fails. The total number of master nodes is 3 or more.
   
   - **Kubernetes version**: select one of the [supported Kubernetes versions](/en/kubernetes/k8s/concepts/versions/version-support).
   - **Availability zone**: select the [availability zone(s)](/en/intro/start/concepts/architecture#az) for nodes. All three availability zones are automatically selected for a regional cluster and cannot be changed.

1. Specify the master node settings:

   - **Category of virtual machine**: select the [VM category](/en/computing/iaas/concepts/about#flavors).

   - **Virtual machine type - Master**: select the [VM configuration template](/en/kubernetes/k8s/concepts/flavors#configuration_templates) for master nodes.

      Templates with high-performance CPUs are available upon request to support. See [Available computing resources](../../../concepts/flavors#configuration_templates) for details.

   - **Master disk type**: [storage type](../../../concepts/storage#storage_types) that will be used by nodes. The disk type you select affects the performance of the cluster.

   - **Number of Master nodes**: select `1`, `3`, or `5` depending on how highly available you want the cluster to be. We recommend creating clusters with 3 or 5 master nodes, as one master node does not provide cluster high availability at the master node level. The number of master nodes for the regional cluster is automatically set to `3`, but you can change it to `5`.

      For more information about cluster topologies and possible configurations, see [Service architecture](../../../concepts/architecture#cluster_topologies).

   - **Disk size on Master node**: the larger the disk size, the better its performance in some disk operations.

1. Specify the network settings:

   - **Network**: select the network and subnet that will host the cluster master and worker nodes. If the required network and subnet are not in the list, [create](/en/networks/vnet/instructions/net#creating_network) them.

      {note:info}

      To create a cluster without internet access, select the network with the connected [Shadow port](/en/networks/vnet/concepts/ips-and-inet#shadow_port) from the list.

      {/note}

   - **Use load balancer network**: enable this option to use a separate subnet in the selected network for load balancers created by the cluster. If the required subnet is not in the list, [create](/en/networks/vnet/instructions/net#creating_network) it. 
     
      By default, the option is disabled and the load balancers use the same subnet as the cluster nodes.

   - **Use pod subnet**: enable this option to specify the subnet that the pods will use to communicate with each other.

      By default, the pods use the `10.100.0.0./16` subnet for communication. If such a subnet already exists in the cluster network, specify a different subnet that is not part of the cluster network to be used by the pods. This is necessary so that the address spaces do not overlap.

   - **Assign external IP**: enable this option so that external IP addresses are assigned to the cluster API endpoint and the pre-installed Ingress controller (if selected in the previous step). Otherwise, IP addresses will be assigned from the cluster subnet.

      By default, the option is enabled, which allows access to the cluster and the Ingress controller from the Internet.

1. Specify other settings:

   - **Trusted Docker Registry**: add Docker Registry addresses to the trusted list to disable HTTPS connection check when connecting to them.

      This can be useful if the Docker registry uses a self-signed SSL or TLS certificate that cannot be validated by the cluster. See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/registry/insecure/#deploy-a-plain-http-registry) for more information on disabling the validation (see the description of the `insecure-registries` setting).

   - **Enable monitoring**: enable this option to install a metrics collection agent in the cluster.

      By default, the option is enabled and allows you to monitor the state of the cluster [using the Cloud Monitoring service](/en/monitoring-services/monitoring/instructions/mon-setup-new).

1. Click the **Next step** button.

## 2. Configure the node groups

1. Set the [settings](../../helpers/node-group-settings) for the worker node group.

1. (Optionally) Add one or more worker-node groups by clicking the **Add node group** button, and [configure](../../helpers/node-group-settings) them.

1. (Optionally) Delete a node group you no longer need by clicking the **Delete node group** button under the respective group.

1. Click the **Create cluster** button.

   This will start the process of creating the Kubernetes cluster. This process might take a long time depending on the size of the cluster.

## What's next?

- [Set up the environment](../../../connect) on the host from which you plan to connect to the cluster.
- [Familiarize yourself with the usage scenarios](../../../how-to-guides) of the cluster.
- [Familiarize yourself with the concepts](../../../concepts) of the container service.
