|JupyterHub or [MLflow Standalone](../../concepts/mlflow-modes#standalone) instance admin password 

|`domain_name`

(optional)
|`str`
|The domain name of the instance. If not specified, it will be created automatically.

Domain name requirements:

- 63 characters maximum length.
- Can contain only digits, lowercase Latin letters and special characters  `.`, `-`.
- Cannot begin and end with the `-` character.

|`flavor`

(mandatory)
|`str`
|The identifier of the configuration template to create the VM instance.

The list of configuration templates and their identifiers can be obtained using the [get_flavors](#get_flavors) method

|`volumes`

(mandatory)
|`List[MLPlatformVolumeIn]`
|A list of the disks of the instance.

Each disk is described by an object of the `MLPlatformVolumeIn` class with fields:

- `size`: the volume of the disk in GB (`int` type).
- `volume_type`: [disk type](/en/computing/iaas/concepts/about#disks_types_b7c586e). Valid values are `VolumeType.ceph_ssd` and `VolumeType.high_iops`.
- `availability_zone`: [availability_zone](/en/intro/start/concepts/architecture#az). Valid values are `AvailabilityZone.GZ1` and `AvailabilityZone.MS1`.

{note:warn}

MLflow instances with only one disk are supported.

{/note}

Example of a disk description:

```python
MLPlatformVolumeIn(
    size=50,
    volume_type=VolumeType.ceph_ssd,
    availability_zone=AvailabilityZone.GZ1)
```

|`networks`

(mandatory)
|`MLPlatformNetworkIn`
|The network to which the instance will be connected. Must match the network of the JupyterHub or [MLflow Standalone](../../concepts/mlflow-modes#standalone) instance to which the MLflow Deploy instance will be connected.

A network is described by an object of `MLPlatformVolumeIn` class with `network_id` field containing the network identifier. The lists of standard and external networks of the project and their identifiers can be obtained using the methods [get_internal_networks](#get_internal_networks) and [get_external_networks](#get_external_networks).

Example of network description:

```python
MLPlatformNetworkIn(network_id="net-12345")
```
|`is_mlflow_demo_mode`

(mandatory)
|`bool`
|Create an MLflow Deploy instance in demo mode:

- `True` - the instance will be created in demo mode.
- `False` - the instance will be created in PRO mode.

Default value: `True`.

{note:warn}

The operating mode of the MLflow Deploy instance must match the operating mode of the MLflow or [MLflow Standalone](../../concepts/mlflow-modes#standalone) instance to which it will be connected.

{/note}

For simplicity, the value of the access token is specified in the Python script example.

When working in a production environment, do not operate tokens in the clear. Use environment variables, secret stores, or other tools to handle sensitive data. [Read more about tokens](../lib-authz).

{/note}

1. [Install the library](../lib-install) if not already done.
1. [Create an access token](../lib-authz) with the `Administrator` role if not already done.
1. Run the Python script:
   ```python
   from mlplatform_client import MLPlatform
   from mlplatform_client.serializers.gateway import MLPlatformVolumeIn, MLPlatformNetworkIn, VolumeType, AvailabilityZone

   # Log in to the library using an access token
   REFRESH_TOKEN = '<ACCESS_TOKEN_VALUE>'
   mlp = MLPlatform(refresh_token=REFRESH_TOKEN)

   # Get the ID of one of the configuration templates in the list of available templates
   flavors = mlp.get_flavors()
   FLAVOR_ID = flavors[0].id

   # Get the ID of one of the standard networks in the list of available networks

For simplicity, the value of the access token is specified in the Python script example.

When working in a production environment, do not operate tokens in the clear. Use environment variables, secret stores, or other tools to handle sensitive data. [Read more about tokens](../lib-authz).

{/note}

1. [Install the library](../lib-install) if not already done.
1. [Create an access token](../lib-authz) with the `User` role, if not already done.
1. Run the Python script:

   ```python
   from mlplatform_client import MLPlatform
  
   # Log in to the library using an access token
   REFRESH_TOKEN = '<ACCESS_TOKEN_VALUE>'
   mlp = MLPlatform(refresh_token=REFRESH_TOKEN)

   # The MLflow Deploy instance must exist and at least one deployment must be available on it

   # Get a list of ML model deployments
   deployments = mlp.list_deployments(
       deploy_server_name="mlflow-deploy-test",
       username="admin", 
       password="Admin123@"
   )

   # Get and display information about the first deployment in the list
   DEPLOYMENT_NAME = deployments[0].name
   deployment_info = mlp.get_deployment(
       deploy_server_name="mlflow-deploy-test",
       deployment_name=DEPLOYMENT_NAME,
       username="admin", 
       password="Admin123@"
   )
   print(deployment_info)

   ```

   If successful, the first ML model deployment in the list on the specified MLflow Deploy instance will be output. Example output:

   ```txt
   ---------------
   Deployment Info:
   ---------------
   name: test_deployment_1
   status: running
   port: 62001
   image_tags: ['test_deployment_1_image:latest', 'test_deployment_image:latest']
   model_ref: https://jh-test-mlp-XXXX.ml.msk.vkcs.cloud/deploy/f27bd56d-XXXX/test_deployment_1
   predict_ref: https://jh-test-mlp-XXXX.ml.msk.vkcs.cloud/deploy/f27bd56d-XXXX/test_deployment_1/invocations
   ```
