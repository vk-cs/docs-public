To connect to an MLflow instance, you need to select its DNS name in your Personal Account and open it in a new browser tab. After that, UI MLflow will be available.

Next, you need to enter the username and password from MLflow.

The MLflow login and password are the same as the JupyterHub login and password. Each user who can log into JupyterHub also has access under the same credentials in MLflow.
