Vision is a face, object, process recognition technology based on machine learning and artificial neural networks. Vision will automate and improve the accuracy of complex visual inspections of varying complexity.

- 98% accuracy of face detection among a million.
- TensorRT on inference, <10ms on photo on GPU.
- 314 scene recognition classes, 25,000 object classes.

Vision technologies are available through APIs that are constantly being expanded. A list of them is available in this help center. Using the API, you can solve such cases as:

- [Recognition of persons](../../service-management/face-recognition);
- [Determination of scenes and objects](../../service-management/vision-api-obj);
- [Classification of documents](../../service-management/vision-api-doctypes);
- [Recognition of the fields of documents](../../service-management/docs-recognition);
- Распознавание знаменитостей;
- [Text recognition on images](../../service-management/vision-api-txt);
- [Detection of cars and their numbers](../../service-management/plate-recognition);
- [Determination of car numbers](../../service-management/plate-recognition);
- [Increased resolution](../../service-management/vision-image-api);
- Identification of defects in production.
