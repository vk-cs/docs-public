The machine learning service is enabled by default in VK Cloud projects. You can connect to the service in two different ways, described below.

### API Endpoint

API Endpoints are "entry points", the URL that connects to the management service. There are two for machine learning:

- Vision for image recognition `https://smarty.mail.ru/`
- Vision for video recognition `https://smarty.mail.ru/`

### Access via client ID and secret key

To control access through the client ID and secret key, the [Vision API page](https://mcs.mail.ru/app/services/machinelearning/vision/access/) displays the required information. The client ID has already been generated and cannot be replaced, and the key can be reissued with the corresponding button.

### Access via service token

To generate a service token, click the button and select the desired scope:

1. Click the Add Service Token button.
2. Select the required scope.
3. Click Create.

The token will be generated and displayed on the page.
