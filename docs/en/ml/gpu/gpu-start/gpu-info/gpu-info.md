## What tasks does

### Machine learning

NVIDIA® Tesla® A100 GPUs are great for training and inferencing deep neural networks with high performance.

### High Performance Computing (HPC)

The solution of tasks that require large computing power is easier to carry out using cloud computing on the GPU. This reduces the time for research and waiting for results.

### Render graphics on the server side

Server-side graphics rendering speed with the most advanced NVIDIA® Tesla® V100 GPU, far exceeds the rendering speed of a conventional graphics card.

The time to solve problems in deep learning, graphical visualization and high-performance computing can be reduced from days to hours. Whether training neural networks, solving complex design problems or cutting-edge research, get the best performance with NVIDIA® Tesla® V100 and VK Cloud.

### GPU-accelerated computing in the cloud

New generations of scientific applications and tasks related to artificial intelligence and machine learning require an enormous amount of computing power that even modern CPU servers cannot cope with. To successfully solve such problems, GPU-accelerated servers are used.

Depending on the type of tasks, 1 modern GPU server can replace up to 100 conventional CPU servers. This is achieved through a different way of performing tasks. The CPU consists of several cores optimized for sequential processing, while the GPU uses thousands of smaller cores to efficiently process parallel tasks.

GPU-based cloud computing will take you to a new level of performance and significantly reduce data processing time, while saving your company money.

VK Cloud provides NVIDIA® Tesla® V100 graphics cards with 16 GB of VRAM.

## Software

VK Cloud recommends using the following GPU-enabled development software:

- CUDA Toolkit — its documentation [is available on the official resource](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).
- Deepo — documentation and distribution [are available on its official resource](https://github.com/ufoym/deepo).
- NVIDIA GRID — Datasheet is [available on the official resource](https://www.nvidia.com/ru-ru/design-visualization/technologies/grid-technology/).

## Billing

Billing per second. Rent and deploy computing power in minutes and turn it off as soon as you complete your tasks. Pay only for the actual use of resources with per-second billing.
