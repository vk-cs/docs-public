Data Platform UI Console (DP Console) is a service to simplify working with Data Platform.

The service provides an additional user interface for centralized management and grouping of data services in Data Platform.

With the service you can:

- Search for the required instance of a data service or a group of services.
- Combine data services into logical groups. Each group can include data services deployed on different clusters.
- Navigate through the groups of data services, view network connectivity between individual instances of services.
- Assign rights to individual data science teams at the service group level. This way, each team of data engineers gets access to a fixed set of data services and is responsible for a specific section of the data pipeline.
- View the event log, which records the actions with the groups, including the actions at the level of granting or revoking access rights to the groups.
