You can work with VK Cloud services not only through [personal account](/en/base/account), but also with the help of additional tools: [OpenStack CLI](/en/manage/tools-for-using-services/openstack-cli), [REST API](/en/manage/tools-for-using-services/rest-api), [Terraform](/en/manage/tools-for-using-services/terraform). These tools allow you to automate cloud resource management workflows using the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach.
