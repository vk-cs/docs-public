## Inviting a new member to the project

You can invite both a user who already has an account in VK Cloud, and an unregistered user.

    The role of superadministrator can be assigned only by the project owner. The role of User Administrator (IAM) can be assigned only by the project owner or superadministrator. You cannot invite a member to the role of the project owner.

    If a member is assigned multiple roles, their permissions are summed up.
