To stop debiting funds for using the services, it is not necessary to delete the account. It is enough to [preserve](/en/tools-for-using-services/account/service-management/project-settings/manage#project_conservation) or [delete](/en/tools-for-using-services/account/service-management/project-settings/manage#deleting_a_project) projects that consume resources.

To delete an account:

1. Make sure that you have transferred all the necessary data from projects and services.

    If you need help with data migration, contact [technical support](mailto:support@mcs.mail.ru).

1. Contact [technical support](mailto:support@mcs.mail.ru) on behalf of the project owner with a request to delete the account.
