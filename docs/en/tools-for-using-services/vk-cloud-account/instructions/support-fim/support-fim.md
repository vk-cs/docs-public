You can configure single sign-on for federation users on the VK Cloud [technical support portal](https://support.mcs.mail.ru).

To configure single sign-on:

1. [Go to](https://cloud.vk.com/account) your VK Cloud account.
1. Navigate to the **Identity Federation** section and open the **Federations** tab.
1. Copy the value of the **Federation ID** parameter.
1. Send a request to [technical support](mailto:support@mcs.mail.ru). In your request, provide the previously obtained federation ID and the list of trusted domains for your organization.

{note:info}
If you have recreated the identity federation, you need to send a request to create single sign-on for the technical support portal again, specifying the new federation ID.
