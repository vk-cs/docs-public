## Content formatting

VK Cloud Documentation uses several ways to highlight different information types.

### Info boxes

There are three types of info boxes:

<info>A hint with additional information that may be helpful.</info>

<warn>Information that is important to know before proceeding.</warn>

<err>Critical information related to possible security issues or data loss.</err>

### Code blocks

Executable commands, configuration files, and program code are displayed in special boxes with syntax highlighting.

To copy the contents of such a block, click the ![ ](../assets/copy-icon.svg "inline") icon in its header.

```javascript
// sample JavaScript code
console.log('Hello World');
```

### Hidden text

For large blocks of code and long examples, blocks of hidden text are used:

<details>
<summary>A closed block looks like this</summary>
An example of hidden text.
</details>

Click the block to see its contents. Click again if you want to hide the text back.

### Tabs

Tabs are used for alternate instructions like commands for different operating systems terminals.

<tabs>
<tablist>
<tab>First tab</tab>
<tab>Second tab</tab>
</tablist>
<tabpanel>

This is what the text looks like on the first tab.

Click the second tab to switch to it.

</tabpanel>
<tabpanel>

This is what the text looks like on the second tab.

Click the first tab to switch to it.

</tabpanel>
</tabs>

If the tabs contain instruction steps that are executed sequentially, the tabs are numbered.
