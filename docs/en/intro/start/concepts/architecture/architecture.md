VK Cloud is a cloud platform that provides network access to computing resources (virtual machines, databases, storage and other services) on a "pay as you go" basis: the fee is charged only for the resources consumed.

You rent virtual resources hosted in VK [data centers](../../../start/concepts/architecture#az) instead of maintaining your own physical servers. This minimises management costs and provides you with access to VK Cloud technical support.

## Deployment models

VK Cloud offers the following deployment models:

- **Public Cloud** is a cloud deployment model in the form of a multi-tenant platform with shared resources (servers, storage, networks). One user's data is isolated from another one's via virtualization, but their data can be physically located on the same servers. VK Cloud manages the infrastructure, including data centre maintenance, hardware procurement, fault tolerance, and network management. 

   Advantages: scalability, pay-as-you-go pricing, access to new technologies.

- **Private Cloud** is a deployment model based on which resources are allocated to a single client (usually, it is an organization). In this case, employees within a single organization can share its infrastructure, but physical and virtual resource sharing between different organizations is prohibited. In Private Cloud, it is the client (organization) that controls and maintains the underlying infrastructure.

   Advantages: data isolation and control, enhanced security. For more details on Private Cloud, refer to [Private installations](/en/on-premises).

## Cloud service delivery models

You can use VK Cloud to deploy virtualization, monitoring, container, and data storage services. The architecture is based on four groups of services:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**. IaaS services are based on [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/software) and proprietary components. They manage dynamic resource allocation, scaling, fault tolerance, and are hosted in the same cloud data centre as PaaS services. IaaS provides basic components: virtual servers, network, data storage, access to dedicated hardware.

   {cut(List of IaaS services)}

  - [Cloud Servers](/en/computing/iaas) — provides virtual machines with the ability to allocate public IPs and unlimited traffic of 1 GBit/s (NVIDIA GPU virtual machines are also available). It is responsible for virtualization and resource integration, and uses KVM hypervisor.
  - [Cloud Storage](/en/storage/s3) — provides S3-compatible object storage. The storage workload is shared across all storage nodes. You can deploy storage with a customizable architecture.
  - [Cloud Networks](/en/networks/vnet) — provides networking within the selected [project](/en/tools-for-using-services/account/concepts/projects) using SDN (Software Defined Network) technology. It is built on OpenStack Neutron and custom-developed software — Sprut. The service includes the following components:

    - [DNS](/en/networks/dns) — supports public and private DNS, providing name resolution for the services of the VK Cloud platform.
    - [CDN](/en/networks/cdn) — organizes content transfer from your servers to users with minimal delay.
    - [Load Balancer](/en/networks/balancing/concepts/load-balancer) — distributes the load on the infrastructure, providing fault tolerance and flexible scaling of applications.
    - [AntiDDoS](/ru/security/firewall-and-protection-ddos#antiddos "change-lang") — filters traffic coming to VK Cloud resources deployed in the project to block DDoS attacks.
    - [WAF](/ru/security/firewall-and-protection-ddos#waf "change-lang") (Web Application Firewall) — configures rules for filtering incoming and outgoing traffic to detect and block network attacks.

  {/cut}

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**. Includes open source solutions (Kubernetes) and solutions of technology partners. Built-in monitoring of VK Cloud services and individual entities is supported. The PaaS model is built on top of IaaS. It does not require management of the underlying infrastructure, including hardware and operating systems, and allows you to devote all your efforts to application development and management.

## Ways to manage VK Cloud services

Cloud services are managed using an API. Users interact with the API through one or more [tools](/en/tools-for-using-services):

  - VK Cloud management console
  - OpenStack CLI
  - Terraform with a separate provider

VK Cloud provides [technical support](/en/intro/start/support/support-info) for it's services. Partner solutions (e.g. AntiDDoS, WAF) are supported together with the partner.

## Fault tolerance

Physical fault tolerance is implemented by placing VK Cloud in three Tier III reliability level data centers in the Russian Federation. With this placement, it is guaranteed to maintain the SLA of data centers of more than 98% with a total [SLA](/en/intro/start/support/sla) of 99.95%.

Network fault tolerance is provided by communication of data centers with routes with a bandwidth of 200 GB/sec. Communication of each server with backbone providers goes through two independent channels, through two routers.

Logical fault tolerance is implemented using availability zones, which are combined into [regions](/en/tools-for-using-services/account/concepts/regions).

{note:info}

The status of the availability zones, services and infrastructure of VK Cloud can be checked on the [service operation status page](https://status.msk.cloud.vk.com).

{/note}

### {heading(Availability zones)[id=az]}

Each availability zone has one or more data processing centers (data centers) where cloud infrastructure objects are physically located. In VK Cloud, the availability zone corresponds to a separate Tier III data center. VK Cloud provides availability zones:

Each data center is equipped with independent power supply and cooling systems.

Availability zones within a region are connected using a redundant dedicated high-bandwidth and low-latency fiber network for high data transfer rates between zones.

The infrastructure of availability zones MS1 and GZ1 of the Moscow VK Cloud region is [protected](https://cloud.vk.com/cloud-platform/certificates/) in accordance with the Federal Law of the Russian Federation “On Personal Data” No. 152-FZ.

## Security

VK Cloud security is ensured by constant monitoring of VK Cloud services, conducting external audits. VK Cloud participates in the security audit program [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com). Infrastructure [certified](https://cloud.vk.com/cloud-platform/certificates/) FSTEC of Russia for working with personal data.

For more information, see the section [Platform security](/en/intro/it-security).

## Migration to VK Cloud

VK Cloud supports migration using [third-party software](../../../migration) or [platform tools](../../../migration/migrate-hystax-mr). The transfer of virtual resources is cheaper due to the implementation of services based on OSS (Open Source Solutions).
