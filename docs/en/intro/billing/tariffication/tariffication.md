Tariffication is based on the “pay as you go” principle: you are charged only for the resources you consume to the nearest minute, the fee for using paid OS is charged once a day.

The cost of network services is given in [price list](https://cloud.vk.com/pricelist). You can use [calculator](https://cloud.vk.com/en/pricing/) to calculate the total cost of platform services.

Available operations:

- To calculate the cost of services, add the necessary services and configure the amount of resources consumed.
- To configure the number of such configurations for the service, use the field **Number of services in this configuration**.
- To view detailed information about the received configuration cost, click on the icon ![Detailed calculation](assets/info_icon.svg "inline") or **Detailed calculation** button.
- To add another configuration of the selected service, click **Add new configuration**.
- To delete the added configuration, click **Remove from calculation**.

The total cost will be displayed in the line **Final calculation**.

<warn>

The total cost is rounded to **two decimal places**. A similar principle applies for [detailing](../service-management/detail/) and  [accounting documents](../concepts/report/).
