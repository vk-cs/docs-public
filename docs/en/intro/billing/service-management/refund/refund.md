## Terms of return

- The request for a refund must be issued by the project owner.
- The money can only be refunded from the [payment account balance](../../concepts/balance/) of the project. The refund amount cannot exceed the amount of unspent funds on the payment account balance.
- The money will be refunded:

  - To individuals — to a bank card or an electronic wallet from which the payment account balance was replenished, based on checks.
  - To legal entities and sole proprietors — to the settlement account of the legal entity or the sole proprietor specified in the application, on the basis of an application for a refund.

- The refund is possible only in the project currency.

<info>

The refund is available regardless of how long ago the payment account balance of the project was replenished.
