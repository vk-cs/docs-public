This article describes the work schemes and opportunities that are available in VK Cloud to individuals and legal entities (including sole proprietors).

By default, the scheme of work for individuals is used in new projects. This scheme does not imply receiving accounting [accounting documents](../report) from VK Cloud.

For the convenience of legal entities or sole proprietors (SP), opportunities have been implemented that allow you to receive accounting documents, optimize document management and help pay for services more conveniently. These options need to be additionally connected and configured in the project.

Organizations and sole proprietors can work with VK Cloud as individuals or legal entities of their choice.

<info>

If you plan to work with VK Cloud as a legal entity or sole proprietor, go through [pre-registration](#additional_registration_of_legal_entities) in your management console.

## Payment scheme

### {heading(Prepayment)[id=prepayment]}

The user [deposits](../../service-management/payment#making_a_payment) the project balance in advance for a certain amount. The deposited funds are transferred to the payment account of the project, from where they are then spent on paying for services. If a project becomes negative, it is automatically [frozen](/en/tools-for-using-services/account/concepts/projects#automatic_freezing_of_the_project) until the payment account balance becomes positive.

<tabs>
<tablist>
<tab>Individuals</tab>
<tab>Legal entities and SP</tab>
</tablist>
<tabpanel>

Individuals work with VK Cloud only on prepayment.

</tabpanel>
<tabpanel>

By default, legal entities and sole proprietors work on prepayment, but they can also work on post-payment.

When working on prepayment, only a universal transfer document is provided to a legal entity from [accounting documents](../report#individuals). Other documents are optional.

</tabpanel>
</tabs>

### Post-payment

The user is billed once a month for using the services. The payment account balance of the project is always negative under this scheme, but the project is not [frozen](/en/tools-for-using-services/account/concepts/projects#automatic_freezing_of_the_project).

<tabs>
<tablist>
<tab>Individuals</tab>
<tab>Legal entities and SP</tab>
</tablist>
<tabpanel>

Individuals cannot work on a post-payment.

</tabpanel>
<tabpanel>

Post-payment work is available if you conclude an [individual contract](#type_of_contract) with VK Cloud, in which this scheme is fixed. By default, legal entities and sole proprietors work on prepayment.

When working on post-payment, only a universal transfer document is provided to legal entities and sole proprietors from [accounting documents](../report#individuals). Other documents are optional.

</tabpanel>
</tabs>

## Type of contract

<tabs>
<tablist>
<tab>Individuals</tab>
<tab>Legal entities and SP</tab>
</tablist>
<tabpanel>

Individuals work with the platform under [public offer agreements](/en/intro/start/legal) relevant services. On the part of VK Cloud, public offer agreements are concluded:

- for projects in [region](/en/tools-for-using-services/account/concepts/regions) Moscow — on behalf of “VK” LLC, registered in the Russian Federation;
- for projects in the region of Kazakhstan — on behalf of “QazCloud” LLP, registered in Kazakhstan.

</tabpanel>
<tabpanel>

Legal entities and sole proprietors work with VK Cloud either on the basis of contracts [public offer](/en/intro/start/legal/) of the relevant services, or under an individual contract.

If you have any questions related to contracts, please write to the document management department of VK Cloud at [docs_vktech@vk.company](mailto:docs_vktech@vk.company).

### Public offer agreements

By default, all users work under public offer contracts. On the part of VK Cloud, public offer agreements are concluded:

- For projects in region Moscow — on behalf of “VK” LLC, registered in the Russian Federation.
- For projects in the region of Kazakhstan — on behalf of “QazCloud” LLP, registered in Kazakhstan.

### Individual agreement

If a legal entity or a sole proprietor is not a resident of the country corresponding to the project region, or you need more flexible terms of the contract — for example, a [postpaid](#post_payment) settlement scheme — [enter into an individual agreement](../../service-management/corporate#conclusion_of_an_individual_contract) with VK Cloud.

## Recommended payment methods

Both individuals and legal entities, including sole proprietors, have access to all [payment methods](../payment-methods) in the relevant region, but some of them are more convenient for individuals, others for legal entities.

<tabs>
<tablist>
<tab>Individuals</tab>
<tab>Legal entities and SP</tab>
</tablist>
<tabpanel>

A bank card linked to the project is the most convenient payment method. Advantages of this method:

- you can set up [auto-top-up](../../service-management/add-card#configure_auto_completion) balance;
- when depositing manually, you do not need to enter the card details every time.

</tabpanel>
<tabpanel>

It is recommended to pay for services by bank transfer, since only such payments can be reflected in [accounting documents](../report#edm).

<info>

Legal entities and sole proprietors can also top up the payment account balance of the project with a bank card, for example, if you need to urgently transfer funds to avoid freezing the project. Write-offs for payments from bank cards are not included in [accounting documents for legal entities](../report#composition_of_accounting_documents): billing report, reconciliation report.

</info>

</tabpanel>
</tabs>

## {heading(Additional registration of legal entities)[id=additional_registration_of_legal_entities]}

[Additional registration](../../service-management/corporate) means saving the details of a legal entity or a sole proprietor in the project settings in the management console. You do not need to specify banking details manually, they are filled in automatically after entering the individual taxpayer number.

After additional registration, those organizations and sole proprietors that work on [prepayment](#payment_scheme) can upload [invoices for payment](../../service-management/bill-generation) with full details from the management console.

## EDM

</tabpanel>
<tabpanel>

Organizations and sole proprietors that work with VK Cloud through the [electronic document management systems (EDM)](../report#edm), receive from VK Cloud [reporting documents](../report) in electronic form.

Organizations and sole proprietors that do not work according to EDO receive [original accounting documents](../report#delivery_of_original_documents) to their mailing address.

By default, EDM is not connected.

<info>

EDM work is available only to organizations-residents of the Russian Federation and sole proprietors who work in [region](/en/tools-for-using-services/account/concepts/regions) Moscow.
