The SDK is a set of development tools that allows you to create applications for the Object Storage service of the VK Cloud S3 platform.

Depending on your use case, you can choose from one of the SDKs or tools:

- [PowerShell Tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/)
- [Java SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/)
- [.NET SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/latest/developer-guide/)
- [JavaScript SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/)
- [Ruby SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/developer-guide/)
- [Python SDK (Boto)](http://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)
- [PHP SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/guide/latest/)
- [Go SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/)
- [Mobile SDK for iOS](https://docs.amplify.aws/)
- [Mobile SDK for Android](https://docs.amplify.aws/)

## Prerequisites

Regardless of the SDK you choose, you must create credentials to access the VK Cloud Object Storage service. To do this, add an account in the "Accounts" menu.

When you create an account, you will be provided with data that you want to save. After closing the window, it will be impossible to restore the Secret Key, but if you lose it, you can create a new account.

**Attention**

The account name must start with a letter or number, it can only consist of Latin letters, numbers and symbols: period (.), Dash (-), underscore (\_).

## PowerShell Tools

Tools for PowerShell is a collection of PowerShell modules that build on the functionality provided by the .NET SDK. PowerShell Tools lets you create scripts to manipulate VK Cloud S3 Object Storage resources from the PowerShell command line.

The cmdlets provide an idiomatic PowerShell interface for specifying parameters and handling the results, even though they are implemented using different VK Cloud HTTP request APIs. For example, PowerShell cmdlets support PowerShell pipelining, which means you can pass PowerShell objects to and from cmdlets.

You can install PowerShell tools on computers running Windows, Linux, or macOS operating systems.

## Java SDK

The Java SDK provides Java APIs for VK Cloud. Using the SDK, you can create Java applications that work with VK Cloud S3 Object Storage. For a list of the supported services and their API versions included in each SDK release, see [the release notes](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java#release-notes) for the version you are currently working with.

[Complete documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/) for working with the Java SDK tools.

## .NET SDK

The .NET SDK makes it easy to build .NET applications using cost-effective, scalable, and reliable VK Cloud services such as VK Cloud S3. The SDK makes it easy to use VK Cloud services by providing a set of libraries that are consistent and familiar to .NET developers.

[Complete documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/latest/developer-guide/) for working with the .NET SDK tools.

## JavaScript SDK

The JavaScript SDK provides a JavaScript API for VK Cloud services. You can use the JavaScript API to build libraries or apps for Node.js or the browser.

Not all services are immediately available in the SDK. You can find out what services are currently supported by the JavaScript SDK on the [official resource](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/SERVICES.md) .

## Ruby SDK

The Ruby SDK helps simplify coding by providing Ruby classes for the VK Cloud Object Storage service.

[Complete documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/developer-guide/) for working with the Ruby SDK tools.

## Python SDK (Boto)

Boto is a Python SDK. It allows Python developers to create, configure and manage the VK Cloud S3 Object Storage service. Boto provides an easy-to-use object-oriented API as well as low-level access to the VK Cloud S3 service.

[Complete documentation](http://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) for working with Python SDK (Boto) tools.

## PHP SDK

The PHP SDK version 3 allows PHP developers to use VK Cloud S3 in their PHP code and build robust applications and software using VK Cloud S3. You can get started in minutes by installing the SDK through Composer, you need the aws / aws-sdk-php package, or by downloading the standalone aws.zip or aws.phar file.

[Complete documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/guide/latest/) for working with the PHP SDK tools.

## Go SDK

The Go SDK is the official AWS SDK for the Go programming language.

The Go SDK provides APIs and utilities that developers can use to create Go applications that use VK Cloud S3.

The SDK removes the complexity of programming directly in the web service interface. It hides many of the lower-level elements such as authentication, request retries, and error handling. The SDK also includes useful utilities on top of the API that add additional features and functionality.

Additional information is available in the [documentation of the s3manager package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/s3/s3manager/) .

[Complete documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/) for working with the Go SDK tools.

## Mobile SDK

Amplify Framework provides a set of UI libraries and components, as well as a command line interface for building mobile backends and integrating with iOS, Android, Web, and React Native apps. The Amplify command line interface allows you to configure all the services required for running the back end through a simple command line interface. The Amplify library makes it easy to integrate back-end code with declarative interfaces and simple user interface components.
