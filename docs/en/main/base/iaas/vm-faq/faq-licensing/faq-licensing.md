## How do I get a Windows Server license?

A licensed copy of the Windows Server operating system is preinstalled in the created instance of a Windows-based virtual machine. The license copy is activated automatically after the instance is created. If an OS activation error occurs, you should [contact technical support](https://mcs.mail.ru/docs/contacts ) and specify the virtual machine ID.

## What licenses can I get?

The list of standard licenses provided is limited, but you can view the list of available ones [on the pricing page](https://mcs.mail.ru/app/project/prices /). To do this, you must be logged in.

If necessary, you can get a license for a software product that is not on this list. To do this, you need to [contact technical support](https://mcs.mail.ru/docs/contacts ) with information about the product and the period of use.

## What types of licensing are there?

Microsoft provides several licensing models that allow you to make the most optimal use of your budget:

- To the core. This licensing model provides access to an unlimited number of users or devices.
- Per user. It is designed to provide access to the license to one user for an unlimited number of servers.

Licensing "per core" within the framework of Microsoft licensing rules for virtual machines means the need to cover every instance virtual core with a license. Regardless of the number of instance cores, licenses are subject to every 2 virtual CPUs.
