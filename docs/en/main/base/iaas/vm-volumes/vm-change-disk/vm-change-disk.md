Available operations in the top menu of the section:

- Creating a disk;
- Connecting an existing disk to an instance.

Available disk context menu operations:

- Changing the disk size;
- View a list of disk snapshots;
- Changing the disk type (requires disconnecting the disk);

## OpenStack CLI

Instance disks are managed using the following commands:

```

```

Attach or detach a disk:
