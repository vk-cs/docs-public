# License transfer

VK Cloud allows you to deploy a number of Microsoft server applications using previously purchased licenses. This simplifies the migration of workloads to the VK Cloud cloud, saving customers from new costs for the purchase of Microsoft licenses. This advantage is available to Microsoft corporate licensing customers with licenses of the corresponding applications under the current Microsoft Software Assurance (SA) agreements. License portability not only simplifies the migration for existing users with SA contracts, but also allows users with perpetual licenses to continue using them, getting all the benefits of efficient work in the cloud.

## How to register

All customers using license portability under the Software Assurance Agreement must go through the license verification process, and Microsoft must confirm that you have eligible licenses in accordance with the applicable Software Assurance (SA) agreement. Fill out the verification form on the [corporate Licensing website](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=28) and provide it to your Microsoft representative or partner who will help you send it to Microsoft. After receiving the form, Microsoft will verify your right to use the benefit and inform you and your chosen authorized mobile solutions partner about the results of the verification.

In the License Portability check form, there is a section for specifying data about an authorized license partner. Use support@mcs.mail.ru as an email address, VK Cloud as the name of the partner and mcs.mail.ru as a partner website. For further instructions, see in the manual [Moving Licenses within Software Assurance](https://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-license-mobility) and in the document [License Mobility Verification Guide](http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/9/b/79bd917e-760b-48b6-a266-796b3e47c47a/License_Mobility_Customer_Verification_Guide.pdf) of Microsoft (pdf).

Microsoft will provide you and VK Cloud with confirmation that you have passed the verification process. You can deploy the application server software until the verification process is complete. In fact, you can deploy ten days before submitting the form. You are responsible for performing inspections and extensions in accordance with the requirements of the agreement.

After passing the verification process, let us know about it to [support service](mhttps://mcs.mail.ru/docs/contacts), indicating the name of the project and the type of license used.
