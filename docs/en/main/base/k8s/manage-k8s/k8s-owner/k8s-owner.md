**Attention**

When deleting the user on whose behalf the cluster was created, cluster management becomes impossible. The cluster is stopped and the cluster's operability cannot be restored.

If it is necessary to change the owner of the cluster, it is recommended to contact [technical support] (mailto:support@mcs.mail.ru ).

You can check the access of project users in the [corresponding section of the personal account](https://mchs.mail.ru/app/access /). You can also add new users with different roles and rights there.
