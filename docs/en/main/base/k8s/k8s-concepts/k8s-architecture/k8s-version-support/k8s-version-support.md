In Kubernetes aaS from VK Cloud Solutions, new versions are mainly added one month after the official release.

The following versions of Kubernetes are currently available in Kubernetes aaS from VK Cloud Solutions:

* 1.22.6
* 1.21.4
* 1.20.4
* 1.19.4
* 1.18.12
* 1.17.8

Kubernetes versions are supported for 14 months from the release date in Kubernetes aaS from VK Cloud Solutions.

A Kubernetes end of support notice will be sent out via email and in your account notification center 30 days before the end of the support date.

When creating a new cluster, choose the latest version of Kubernetes available. We strongly recommend upgrading your cluster to the latest version available, if possible.

If the cluster is created on a version of Kubernetes that is no longer supported, we cannot guarantee its correct operation. All emerging problems with the cluster should be solved by the user independently.
