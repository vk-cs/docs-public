If the cluster is not using the most current version of Kubernetes from [the list](../../concepts/versions/version-support/), it can be upgraded to a newer version of Kubernetes. When updating a cluster, part of its components are also [updated](../../concepts/update/), as well the installed addons.

You cannot downgrade to a lower version of Kubernetes when upgrading. Clusters of versions 1.16 and below can only be upgraded by transferring a backup of data to a new cluster of the correct version, for example [using Velero](../../use-cases/velero-backup).

<warn>

- If a [component](../../concepts/update/), that is to be updated with the cluster, is deleted, then it will be restored during the next cluster update.

- When the cluster is updating, the current CoreDNS [Corefile](https://coredns.io/2017/07/23/corefile-explained/) is overwritten with the new one with default settings.

  If the cluster uses a modified Corefile, then back it up prior to updating the cluster.

</warn>

## Before updating

1. Examine [update procedure](../../concepts/update/).
1. Back up the cluster you plan to update, for example, using Velero.
1. Deploy the backup to the new cluster which is identical to the one you plan to update. Use it to verify that the update procedure goes smoothly: all cluster data and applications remain available, and applications behave as expected.
1. [Set threshold](../manage-node-group#configure-update-settings) of the number of unavailable worker nodes in the node groups.
