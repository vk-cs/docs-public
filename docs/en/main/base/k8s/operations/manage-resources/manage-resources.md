It is possible to manage Kubernetes resources in Kubernetes cluster via VK Cloud personal account web interface. This functionality serves as alternative to `kubectl` and Kubernetes Dashboard.

## Viewing information about cluster resources

1. Go to [VK Cloud personal account](https://mcs.mail.ru/app/en/).
1. Select the project and region where the necessary cluster is located.
1. Go to **Containers â†’ Kubernetes Clusters**.
1. Click on the name of the desired cluster.
1. Go to the **Cluster resources** tab.

   All the cluster's Kubernetes resources are listed here. They are grouped into **Sections**.

1. Select the section from the drop-down list and click on the necessary category.

Additionally it is possible to:

- View the resources' data by clicking the corresponding element in the **Data** parameter.

- Specify a search request in the **Search** field.

  The entered search request is saved when moving between the sections.

- Filter resources by **Namespaces**.

  The filter is saved when moving between the sections.

  Some Kubernetes resources can not be filtered by the namespace filter. See the information in the list of available resources below.
