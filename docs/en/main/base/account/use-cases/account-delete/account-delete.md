If you no longer plan to use VK Cloud services, delete your account. Along with it, all projects in which you are the owner will be deleted.

<err>

After deletion, it is impossible to restore the account.

To stop debiting funds for using the services, it is not necessary to delete the account. It is enough to [preserve](../../instructions/project-settings/manage#project_conservation) or [delete](../../instructions/project-settings/manage#deleting_a_project) projects that consume resources.

To delete an account:

1. Make sure that you have transferred all the necessary data from projects and services.

    If you need help with data migration, contact [technical support](/en/contacts).

1. Contact [technical support](/en/contacts) on behalf of the project owner with a request to delete the account.

    You will be contacted for confirmation. Deletion is possible only after correspondence with the user from his registered mail.

1. If necessary, perform [refund](/en/additionals/billing/operations/refund).
