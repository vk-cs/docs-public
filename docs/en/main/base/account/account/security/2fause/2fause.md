Logging into an account with 2FA enabled is carried out by the following steps

- Go to the [VK Cloud] website (https://mcs.mail.ru) and click the "Login" button;
- Enter the username and password of the account;
- Enter a one-time 6-digit code generated by the mobile application and confirm the entry with the "Login" button.

<info>

A one-time code is valid for ~30 seconds from the moment it was generated.

There is no limit to the number of login attempts, but if after a certain number of attempts you still cannot log in, you should use one of the unused backup codes to access your account, then disable 2FA and re-enable it.
