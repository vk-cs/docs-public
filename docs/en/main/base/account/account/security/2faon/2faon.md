In [personal account](https://mcs.mail.ru/app/account/profile) for enhanced account security, it is possible to enable two-factor authentication.

Two-factor authentication, also known as two-step verification (DFA or 2FA), is a type of multi-factor authentication. DFA is a technology that provides user identification through a combination of two different components. The components can be different, but the following combinations are most often used:

- password + code from SMS
- password + code from the token (or application)
- password + code from email message

VK Cloud services use a password + code combination from the application. Installation information and links to download applications for generating one-time codes are below:

- [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447)
- [Duo](https://duo.com/product/trusted-users/two-factor-authentication/duo-mobile)

Enabling two-factor authentication is available in [account settings](https://mcs.mail.ru/app/account/profile) on the "Security" tab by clicking the "Enable protection" button:

To successfully activate the function, you must:

- Download the Google Authenticator mobile app ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)) or Duo ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duosecurity.duomobile&hl=en) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/duo-mobile/id422663827?mt=8))
- Open the app and add a new account
- Scan the QR code from your personal account in the application
- Enter the confirmation code generated by the application and the password from the VK Cloud account in your VK Cloud account
- Confirm the entry with the "Enable" button.

<info>

If you cannot read the QR code, you can enter the application connection code manually by clicking on the appropriate link under the QR code in the window.

As a confirmation of adding the 2FA key in the next step, the window will display backup access codes.

<warn>

Keep your backup codes in a safe place.

If the backup codes are lost and there is no access to the mailbox to which the account is registered, it will be impossible to restore access to the VK Cloud account.
