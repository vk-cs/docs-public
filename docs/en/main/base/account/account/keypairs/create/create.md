To connect to a virtual machine via SSH, you must use a key pair: the public key is hosted on the virtual machine, while the private key is stored by the user.

You can create a new key pair during the instance creation step or in the Key Pairs section.

To create a new key pair:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -m pem -f "path to file"
```

3. Specify the name of the file where the keys will be saved and enter the password.

The public part of the key will be saved in the `<key_name>.pub` file. Paste this part of the key into the SSH key field when creating a new virtual machine.
