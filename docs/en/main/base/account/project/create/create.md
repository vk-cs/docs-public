Projects are organizational units in the cloud to which users can be assigned. A user can be a member of one or more projects.

During registration, a user with the "Project Owner" role and the project itself are created. You can assign one or more projects to a user, and change or remove an assignment. You can learn more about roles and their capabilities [here](/ru/docs/base/account/concepts/rolesandpermissions).

Additional projects can be created to separate resources, roles, or other architectural features of the tasks being implemented.

You can create a project in your personal account in the header of the page. For this:

1. Click "+ Add New Project".
2. Enter a name for the project. The name should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and numbers, from 4 to 60 characters long. It is allowed to use the characters ".", "_", "-" (except for the first and last characters).
3. Click Save.

When creating a new project, the user receives the role of "Owner" regardless of his role in the current project.
