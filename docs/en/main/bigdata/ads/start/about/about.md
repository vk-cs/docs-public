To solve the problems of stream processing of large amounts of data, VK Cloud Big Data services allow you to create Arenadata Streaming clusters that provide the ability to safely and efficiently manage streams in real time.

Arenadata Streaming (ADS) is a fault-tolerant and scalable streaming data processing system built on Apache Kafka and Apache NiFi. The main distinguishing features of ADS include:

1. Fault tolerance - ensuring consistency in real-time data streaming;
1. Scalability - adding new servers to the cluster as needed;
1. Distribution - the ability to build a geo-distributed infrastructure;
1. Real time - flow control, adding and configuring data sources in real time;
1. Security - flexible mechanisms for controlling access to data;
1. Integration - connectors to various systems: Elasticsearch, SAP HANA, Vertica, Couchbase, Cassandra, CouchDB, IBM MQ and all DBaaS that are now in the cloud.
1. A wide range of APIs for integration with other external systems;
1. Flexibility - the ability to create a workflow using a graphical interface or develop your own applications using the SDK to improve work efficiency.
