The LAMP stack includes the Linux operating system, the Apache web server, the MySQL database management system, and a server-side scripting language for processing PHP dynamic content. All this is necessary to support dynamic sites and web applications.

Installing a LAMP stack on a CentOS 7.6 operating system is similar to installing a LAMP stack on a CentOS 7.4 operating system ([read how to install a LAMP stack on CentOS 7.4](https://mcs.mail.ru/help/lamp-on-linux/lamp -centos-7-4)).

## How to save time installing a LAMP stack

You can get a ready-made LAMP stack on Ubuntu 18.04 as a [configured VK Cloud virtual machine](https://mcs.mail.ru/app/services/marketplace/). When registering, you get a free bonus account, which is enough to test the server for several days.
