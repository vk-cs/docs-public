After you have installed the replication agent on the protected host, you can start replicating the protected infrastructure. To do this, click on “…” and select “Start Replication” from the drop-down menu. The replication process itself can take a long time depending on the amount of data on the disk and network bandwidth.

Upon successful completion of the replication process, the status of the replicated host is marked as "Synced".

After completing the replication process, proceed to create a migration plan and start migrating the protected infrastructure.
