Once these hosts are replicated, you can migrate the hosts themselves to Target Cloud. To do this, you need to create a migration plan (Migration plan), which indicates which hosts will be migrated.

On the main screen of your Hystax Acura user account, click "Add Migration plan". Go to the "Expert" tab and click on "Generate Migration plan from all machines".

A migration plan will be generated in the form of a JSON document containing a description of all hosts added to the personal account with the default parameter value.

You can learn more about setting up a migration plan in the Migration Plan Syntax section.

Specify the name of the migration plan and click the "Save" button.

After completing the creation and configuration of the migration plan, proceed to start migrating the protected infrastructure.
