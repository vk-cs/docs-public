Cloud Disaster Recovery is a cloud service for restoring IT infrastructure and data after disasters, for example, failures in the operation of IT systems and other force majeure: data center accidents, massive errors, fires, floods, power consumption. With its help, business processes will not be interrupted at a critical time, even if the company's main data center fails completely.
