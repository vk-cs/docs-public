The MLOps Platform from VK Cloud Solutions is a set of services and tools designed to solve typical tasks of Data Science and ML teams.

MLOps can be defined as a discipline or set of practices whose purpose is to develop and support services based on ML models. This discipline was born at the junction of the spheres of Machine Learning, DevOps and Data Engineering.

MLOps tasks usually include:

- Conducting experiments with data
- Training of ML models
- Deployment of the obtained ML models into various environments, such as, for example, development and production
- Monitoring the behavior of models in production
- Updating of the operated ML-models.

To solve MLOps tasks, VK Cloud Solutions provides the following services:

- JupyterHub — a tool for working with Jupiter Notebook in multi-user mode;
- MLflow — a tool for solving problems of tracking and versioning experiments, ML models. (In development)
