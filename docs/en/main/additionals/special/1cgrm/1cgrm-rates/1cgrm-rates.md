## The cost

For all software products of the 1C: GRM service, the general principle of cost calculation operates, regardless of the type of application, consisting of 3 basic components:

<table style="width: 99%; margin-right: calc(1%);"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 70.9434%; text-align: center; background-color: rgb(239, 239, 239);">Component</td><td style="width: 29.0566%; text-align: center; background-color: rgb(239, 239, 239);">Composition</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 70.9434%;">Software product license</td><td style="width: 29.0566%; text-align: center;">60% of the cost</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 70.9434%;">Infrastructure</td><td style="width: 29.0566%; text-align: center;">30% of the cost</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 70.9434%;">Support</td><td style="width: 29.0566%; text-align: center;">10% of the cost</td></tr></tbody></table>

The table shows the proportional ratio of the cost of the components of the 1C: timing service.

The calculation of the monthly cost of each component is made automatically in the personal account when the application is launched and depends on the type of application and the number of its users.

The base cost of applications is determined as follows:

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="435"><tbody><tr><td height="19" style="background-color: rgb(239, 239, 239);" width="54.48275862068966%">application</td><td style="background-color: rgb(239, 239, 239);" width="45.51724137931034%">The cost</td></tr><tr><td height="19">Accounting department</td><td>900 ₽ per month for 1 license</td></tr><tr><td height="19">Salary and Personnel Management</td><td>960 ₽ per month for 1 license</td></tr><tr><td height="19">Managing Our Firm</td><td>960 ₽ per month for 1 license</td></tr></tbody></table>
