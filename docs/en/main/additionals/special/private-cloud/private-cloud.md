Private cloud integrates all VK CS cloud services powered by Openstack products. Also referred to as an internal or enterprise cloud, a private cloud provides companies with many of the benefits of a public cloud, including self-service, scalability, and elasticity, as well as additional control and customization of the hosted on-premises computing infrastructure available from dedicated resources. In addition, private clouds provide a high level of security and privacy through the use of company firewalls and internal hosting, which prevents third-party providers from accessing operations and sensitive data.
