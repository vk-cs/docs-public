VK Cloud app store includes a number of solutions for comfortable development.

**Docker** is software for automating the deployment and management of applications in containerized environments. This software allows you to package an application with all its environment and dependencies into a container that can be ported to any Linux system with support for cgroups in the kernel, and also provides an environment for managing containers.

The VK Cloud marketplace offers two components for correct and convenient work with applications — the Docker CE (Community Edition) software itself and the Docker Registry - a server application for hosting and distributing an unlimited number of public docker images.

The Docker Registry can be used to control where images are stored and distributed, and to integrate the storage and distribution of images during development.

## Application Development Kits

**GitLab CE** (Community Edition) is an open source Git repository management and collaborative project management system.

The minimum requirements for installing GitLab are 4 CPU and 4 RAM to support Dot 500 users.

**Sonatype Nexus** is a private maven repository that performs the following tasks: proxying libraries for quick access to them (it is advisable if nexus is on a local network — libraries are downloaded to nexus once from different repositories and then stored there); release of libraries of different versions.

Unlike the Nexus 2, the Nexus 3 has a Docker Registry feature.

**Apache Tomcat** is an open source servlet container and web server that supports many large-scale applications across a wide variety of industries and organizations.

Implements the Servlet Specification, JavaServerPages Specification, and JavaServerFaces Specification. Allows you to run web applications and contains a number of self-configuring programs.

**Wordpress** is an open source content management system. Wordpress uses PHP and MySQL, which are supported by almost all hosting providers. Scope of application - from blogs to complex news resources. The built-in system of "themes" and "plug-ins" together with a good architecture allows you to design projects of wide functional complexity.

**Jenkins** is an open source Java software system designed to provide a continuous software integration process. Jenkins allows you to automate the non-human part of the software development process by providing continuous integration functionality. Supports version control system tools including AccuRev, CVS, Subversion, Git, Mercurial, Perforce, Clearcase, RTC. Can build projects using Apache Ant and Apache Maven, and execute arbitrary shell scripts and Windows batch files. A build can be started in different ways, for example, on a commit event in the source control system, on a schedule, on a request to a specific URL, after another build in the queue completes.

## Developer stacks

LAMP stack is a set of server software. Includes the following components:

- LEMP stack;
- MEAN stack;
- Monitoring;
