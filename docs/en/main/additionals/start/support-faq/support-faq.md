To speed up the processing of your request, inform the technical support about your account information: login, project name and describe the issue in as much detail as possible.

</info>

If possible, attach any available diagnostic information: screenshots, logs and other materials.

## How quickly does support respond?

Information about the timing of the response and the provision of a solution is in the [SLA](https://mcs.mail.ru/help/en_US/support/support-info) section.

## I cannot change my phone number

After registering a phone number, changing it is possible only through a request to technical support. The support team will contact the current owner to confirm the phone change.

## Can't register with my phone number

If your phone number belongs to a country other than the Russian Federation, and has a prefix (code) not +7, then registration of such a phone will not be possible through your VK Cloud personal account.

## I forgot my account password

If for some reason you cannot access your account, you can recover your password using the "Recover password" option on the login screen.

## Lost my two-factor authentication app

Two-factor authentication can only be restored by disabling this option by the technical support team. Our specialists will make sure that you are the owner of the account, and then deactivate this option for your account.

## I did not receive bonus points upon registration

Bonus points are awarded when the first project is created in VK Cloud; this option is not available for subsequent projects.

## I do not have enough quotas

The expansion of resource quotas is performed upon request to technical support.

## How do I delete my account?

The account can be deleted upon request to technical support on behalf of the project owner's account. Before deleting an account, delete all existing resources, and also unlink the card (if any).

## I do not receive letters from support

If you don't receive an email response, try the following:

- Check the "Spam" and "Trash" folder in your mail
- Check if the MX record is configured correctly on your mail domain (if you have your own domain for mail)
- Try to send a letter to yourself from any other (test) mailbox
- Contact another communication channel

## What if I didn't find the answer to my question?

We are constantly adding information to the Documentation portal. If you did not find the answer to your question on the portal, [send your question](/en/contacts) to our support.
