Bonuses, or bonus points are virtual funds credited by the platform to the dedicated [bonus account](../../start/balance#bonus-account) of a project. Bonus points can be used to pay for services. No funds are debited from the main project account until there are still funds on the bonus account; for details, see the article [Balance](../../start/balance#accounts-usage).

One bonus point for [region](/ru/base/account/concepts/regions) Moscow equals one ruble, for region Kazakhstan — one tenge.

 Bonus points are credited:

- When a new account is [registered](../../../start/get-started/account-registration) on the platform. These sign-up bonus points are credited only once, after services are activated in the [project](/en/base/account/concepts/projects) that is created for the account. The amount of bonuses depends on the region of the project:

  - Moscow — 3000 bonuses;
  - Kazakhstan — 24000 bonuses;

  Unspent sign-up bonuses expire in 60 calendar days after the account registration.

- During advertising campaigns;
- When paying refunds for the technical failures that occurred through the fault of VK Cloud.

Bonus points are not returned during a [refund](../../operations/refund).
