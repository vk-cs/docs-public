The balance is the current state of funds on the VK Cloud [project](/en/base/account/concepts/projects) accounts. For each new project, two accounts are created automatically: the main and the bonus account.

The balance state can be seen in the [personal account](https://mcs.mail.ru/app/):

- the balance amount — in the upper part of the personal account page;
- balance details, with statistics for each account and [detailed expenses](../../operations/detail) — on the separate Balance page.

    For details, see section [Top up balance](/en/additionals/billing/operations/payment#viewing-the-balance).

<info>

The Balance page is available if [services are activated](/en/base/account/start/activation) in the project.

## Main account

The main account is a project account that a user can replenish using one of the available [payment methods](../payment-methods). Money from this account can be [refunded](../../operations/refund) if necessary.

## Bonus account

The bonus account is a project account that is used for storing [bonuses](../../concepts/bonus). A user cannot replenish a bonus account, bonuses can be credited by the platform only. Bonuses cannot be refunded.

## Accounts Usage

Services can be paid from both accounts. Funds are first debited from the bonus account, and then from the main account.
