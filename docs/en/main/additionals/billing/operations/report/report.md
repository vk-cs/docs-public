When making a payment, individuals receive a payment receipt in accordance with [FZ-54](https://base.garant.ru/12130951/) "On the use of cash register equipment". The receipt is sent to the email address of the VK CS project owner. The original payment receipt is not provided.

At the end of the reporting period, subject to the crediting of funds to the account from a legal entity and the completed details of the organization in the project settings, closing financial documents may be available.

<warn>

When making payments for services with bank cards and other methods other than paying an invoice from a legal entity, these payments are not reflected in the Reconciliation Report and are not provided for the formation of the UPD.

</warn>

The UPD form contains all the details of the invoice set out in clauses 5, 5.1, 5.2 of Article 169 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation. If there is an UPD, an invoice or an Act of work performed are not provided separately.

The UPD can be obtained in one of the following ways:

### Document Management (EDO)

Electronic document management is the main way of exchanging electronic documents in VK CS, carried out through telecommunication communication channels (TCS) of the EDO operator.

An electronic document is a file certified with an electronic signature. It does not need to be printed out, since it is a legally significant original in electronic form.

Electronic document management (EDI) occurs through the system of the EDI operator included in the trust network of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation.

What do electronic documents give and why connect to EDO:

- Instantly forward documents;
- Reduce financial costs;
- Optimize business processes;
- Simplify interaction with government agencies;
- Increase the loyalty of counterparties;
- Transfer the archive to electronic form.

VK CS uses the [Contour.Dyadok](https://www.diadoc.ru/) and [VLSI](https://sbis.ru/).

You can connect to one of these EDI systems yourself by sending an invitation to one of these systems. The request must specify the name of the organization, full details, including the full name of the general director, and the system to which the organization will be connected. 

When working with another operator, you need to configure roaming yourself by specifying the following details:

- ID of the EDO participant: 2BM-7743001840-2012052807514600749280000000000.

### Russian Post

Paper originals of documents are sent by Russian Post after the 15th day following the reporting period of the month.

The documents are sent after the request to [technical support](https://mcs.mail.ru/docs/ru/contacts) and to the address of the recipients, in whose projects the details of the legal address are indicated.

The reconciliation report is provided individually upon request to technical support. The application should specify the details of the organization, the project, as well as the reporting period of the required act.

<warn>

If for some reason it was not possible to receive the document through the EDO or the Russian Post, you can request a copy of the UPD in *.pdf format by contacting [technical support](https://mcs.mail.ru/docs/ru/contacts).

The request should specify the name and details of the organization, the project and the reporting period of the closing document.

### Tax accounting

For tax residents of the Russian Federation, the amount of VAT is indicated in payment and accounting documents.
