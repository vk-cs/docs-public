All deductions and additions for projects are recorded in the VK Cloud personal account on the project [balance page](https://mcs.mail.ru/app/en/services/billing).

Expenses details are available to users with the [roles](/en/base/account/concepts/rolesandpermissions) of Owner, Superadministrator, Project administrator and Billing administrator.

<warn>

Deductions and additions for projects in the Moscow [region](/en/base/account/concepts/regions) are tied to the Moscow Time Zone (GMT+3), in the Kazakhstan region —  to the Astana Time Zone (GMT+6).

The same principle applies to [the formation of accounting documents](../report/).
