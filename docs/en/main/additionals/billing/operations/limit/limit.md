In order to ensure the stability of resources in projects, billing sends notifications of several types:
- Excess of expenses
- Reaching balance thresholds

You can set up a spending limit for each project in the current calendar month on the "Limits" tab in the "Balance and Payments" section. When the specified limit is reached, a notification will be sent.

<warn>

You can activate this option only on behalf of the account of the owner or co-owner of the project.

</warn>

The billing system will also help to predict the time when the balance will be spent by sending a notification 14 days before the zero balance is reached.
