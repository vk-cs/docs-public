VK Cloud sends notifications about exceeding the spending limit to ensure stable operation of resources in projects.

You can set up a spending limit for each project in the current calendar month on the **Limits** tab in the **Balance and Payments** section. When the specified limit is reached, a notification will be sent.

<warn>

You can activate this option only on behalf of the account of the owner or co-owner of the project.
