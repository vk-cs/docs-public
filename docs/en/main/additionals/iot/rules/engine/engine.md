The business rules engine is a distributed platform for executing custom code (business rules) in Python.

With business rules, you can do the following:

- Validation, transformation and routing of data flow from devices.
- Analytics on the flow of events from devices in quasi-real time.
- Integration with external systems via HTTP.
- Export data stream to external systems.

Business rules are divided into two types:

1. Reactive rules, which are designed to process the data stream from devices in quasi-real time.
2. Cron rules that run according to a given schedule.
