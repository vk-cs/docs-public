System status is a tool for informing about the current situation in real time. It allows you to get information about statuses and incidents that occur on the VK CS platform. The interface reflects information about the following infrastructure objects of VK CS:

- Accessibility zones
- Services
- Infrastructure

The interface is accessed from [personal account](https://mcs.mail.ru/app/main/) in the account drop-down menu or via [link](https://status.mcs.mail.ru/).

When the service status changes, the changes will be reflected in the interface in real time.
