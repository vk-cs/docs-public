## Antifraud

Antifraud in VK Cloud is a set of security measures and rules aimed at filtering bot and auto user registrations, as well as preventing potential attacks on VK Cloud platform resources.

If after confirming the mailing address and phone number in the VK Cloud panel, when trying to activate services, a notification appears about the need to confirm your data, you should use one of the proposed methods of verifying your identity.

When you select a method, the corresponding section will open:

- **Binding a bank card**. Link a card and, if necessary, pay for VK Cloud services.
- **Selfie with passport** **(only for citizens of the Russian Federation)**. In your message, attach a high-quality photo that clearly shows your face and your passport details.
- **Company card (for legal entities)**. Attach a file with the details of the organization on behalf of which the registration is being carried out. The postal address must, at the same time, indicate the name or other details of the organization.

## Suspicious activity

Users of Internet resources, as well as automated services, have the right to complain about suspicious activity performed by clients of the VK Cloud platform. Mechanisms include manual and automatic registration of complaints.

They detect IP addresses with suspicious behavior, such as if a visitor accesses the same web page at short intervals, fills in the wrong password multiple times, etc.

Such behavior is marked as potentially dangerous, then the IP address from which suspicious activity occurs is added to the gray lists, after which a complaint is sent to the owner of the IP address. If the activity is removed, the IP address is removed from the greylist.

This security feature is globally active on all of our servers and cannot be disabled. Without this feature, the security of the VK Cloud platform would be low.

The IP addresses allocated to virtual machines belong to the VK Cloud platform and can be reassigned by both the user and the system when the user releases the IP address assigned to his project. In order to provide customers with uninterrupted services, technical support promptly responds to such complaints by eliminating activity.

<warn>

Technical support reports the existence of a complaint to the project owner at the registered postal address.

If you are an active user of the services, then technical support will definitely warn you about the existence of such a complaint. If there is no response for more than 1 day, the IP address can be disconnected from the instance and released from the project.

In order not to encounter a situation of suspicious activity conducted from a virtual machine, you should follow the security rules:

- Do not set simple passwords for accounts
- Do not provide uncontrolled access to your created resources
- Pay attention to downloaded and installed software
- Scan instances for malware or code

</warn>

## DDoS Protection

DoS (Denial of Service) is a hacker attack on a computer system with the aim of bringing it to failure, that is, the creation of such conditions under which conscientious users of the system will not be able to access the provided system resources (servers), or this access will be difficult. The failure of the attacked system can also be a step towards mastering the system (if, in an emergency situation, the software gives out any critical information - for example, version, part of the program code, etc.).

VK Cloud provides DDoS protection service. For more detailed information, as well as the calculation of the cost, you should send a request through your personal account in the "Special Services" section.

The cost of services for services "Protection from DDoS" is calculated individually.
