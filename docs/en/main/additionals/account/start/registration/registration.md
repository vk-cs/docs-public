To register, go to the [main page](https://mcs.mail.ru) of VK Cloud services and click on the "Create a VK Cloud account" or "Try" button.

Enter your username (your valid email) and create a password.

To get started, you need to [register on the platform](/docs/additionals/start/get-started/registration). This is necessary even if you want to familiarize yourself with the interface and test the services for free. To register, you will need to confirm your email, indicate your phone number and link a payment card. We will not deduct money from your account until you start using the resources of the project.

After registration, new customers receive welcome bonuses to their bonus account so that you can test the service for 60 days. Read more about bonus points [here](docs/ru/additionals/billing/concepts/promotions). After testing, you need to replenish the balance of the main account.
