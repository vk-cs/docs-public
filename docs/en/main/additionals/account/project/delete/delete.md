If the positive balance is not restored, the project resources will be placed in the queue for deletion, depending on the availability of payments for the entire period of the project's existence:

- If there were no cash flows in the project, then after 3 days all resources will be deleted;
- If the payment was made, then the resources will be placed in the queue for deletion 30 days (or when the balance is equal to -1000 rubles) after the services stop.

The deletion queue is a mechanism for cleaning resources, in which data from the project and the VK CS platform are permanently deleted, without the possibility of their recovery.

## Deleting a project

Project deletion is possible through [technical support request](mailto:support@mcs.mail.ru) on behalf of the project owner. Before deleting a project, make sure that there are no associated automatic payment methods, and that all necessary data has been exported from the project. To execute the request, you must specify the name of the project to be deleted.
