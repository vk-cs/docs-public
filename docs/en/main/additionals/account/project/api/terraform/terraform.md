With Terraform, you can manage infrastructure in the cloud as code (IaC). This allows you to spend less time on routine operations and reduces the risk of errors through the use of scripts.

You can learn more about working with Terraform in the VK Cloud infrastructure [on the Terraform documentation portal](https://mcs.mail.ru/docs/ru/additionals/terraform).

To use Terraform, you need to upload the openrc configuration file in [project settings in your account](https://mcs.mail.ru/app/project/terraform/). Each region has its own configuration file. For more information about regions, see the article [Regions](/ru/additionals/start/user-account/regions).
