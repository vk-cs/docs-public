## Password managers

For the convenience of storing and using a large number of account passwords, backup codes and other confidential information in a virtual storage protected by a master password, locked using the [PBKDF2] standard (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2 "PBKDF2") , you can use third-party software, for example:

- [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/)
- [1password](https://1password.com/)

The password database can be stored locally or synchronized between other trusted devices.
