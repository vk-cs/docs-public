## API Endpoint

API Endpoint is a "entry point", a URL used to connect to a service for management. For machine learning, there are two of them:

- Vision for image recognition    https://smarty.mail.ru/
- Vision for video recognition    https://smarty.mail.ru/

## Access via client ID and secret key

To control access via client ID and private key, [the Vision API page](https://mcs.mail.ru/app/services/machinelearning/vision/access/) displays the necessary information. The client ID has already been generated and cannot be replaced, and the key can be reissued with the appropriate button:
