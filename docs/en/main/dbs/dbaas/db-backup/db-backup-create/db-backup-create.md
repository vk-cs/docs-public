When creating a database, a backup plan is created in the VK CS panel, which can be managed in the ["Backups"](https://mcs.mail.ru/app/services/databases/backups/) section of the control panel.

The current status of the plan can be seen by hovering the mouse over the colored status indicator.

4.  Click the "Save" button to apply the changes.

### Stop plan

If for some reason you need to stop creating backups, select the desired plan and click on the "Stop" button. The creation of backups will be paused until the plan is activated manually.

### Note

Changing the backup schedule activates the plan

### Deleting a plan

In case the original instance is deleted, it is possible to delete the backup plan for the instance as well. Select the required plan with a tick and click on the "Delete" button.![](./assets/1595171357144-plan3.png)
