VK Cloud allows you to create and manage database instances using Terraform: after [initial configuration of the toolkit](/en/manage/terraform/quick-start), use the examples given in the [Terraform step-by-step instructions](/en/manage/terraform/scenarios/).

The use of DBaaS management software on the VK Cloud platform reduces the time for processing and performing DBMS deployment and management operations.
