## Connecting to an instance

<warn>

**Attention**

Connecting externally requires an ADB instance with external IP enabled. You can learn more about enabling an external IP address on the [“Creating a Cluster”](../../../adb-start/create-adb/) page.

<warn>

To connect to an ADB instance, use the [database instance connection instructions](../../../../dbaas/dbaas-start/db-connect/).

When using the examples, replace `<HOST>` with the external IP address of the instance.

Additional information can be found in the documentation for the connector used (a connector is an entity that connects to a database).
