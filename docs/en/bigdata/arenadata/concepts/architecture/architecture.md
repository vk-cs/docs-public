Arenadata's Hadoop distribution is designed to handle large amounts of data by building networks of thousands of nodes to run containerized applications.

This functionality is supported by Hadoop technology, which efficiently handles requests between containers on network nodes. You can learn more about how the technology works in the [documentation](https://docs.arenadata.io/adh/administration/hdfs/Federation.html) of the developer of the Arenadata ADH distribution.
