Billing is carried out according to the “pay as you go” principle: the fee is charged only for the resources consumed with an accuracy of up to a second.

The configuration and cost of the services are given in the [price list](https://cloud.vk.com/pricelist). To calculate the total cost of the service, you can use the [calculator](https://cloud.vk.com/pricing). For information on how the tools related to the payment of platform services work, see the section [Billing](/en/additionals/billing/).
