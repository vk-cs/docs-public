MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL-type open source DBMS written in C++. This DBMS stores data in the form of collections of documents that have a format similar to JSON. MongoDB is effective when:

- The data does not have a clear structure, or their structure may change.
- You need to process a large stream of requests in real time.

MongoDB can be used, for example, to store product catalogs, geo-analytics data, social media materials and various media platforms. You can also store files in MongoDB â€” the GridFS specification is implemented for this.

For more information, see [official MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/).
