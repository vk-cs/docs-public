Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is a highly efficient NoSQLâ€”type open source DBMS that stores data in RAM in the form of key/value pairs. The main advantage of Redis is that it has no competitors in performance, even among its analogues.

Redis is optimal for tasks where speed is a priority: for caching data, storing user sessions, for implementing chats, queues, message brokers, real-time analytics, and others.

For more information, see [official Redis documentation](http://redis.io/docs/).

The list of Redis versions that are supported in VK Cloud is available when [creating](../../../instructions/create/) an instance of this database.
