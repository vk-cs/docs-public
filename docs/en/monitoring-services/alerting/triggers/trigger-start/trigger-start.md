If a trigger fires more than 100 times within 24 hours, it will automatically turn off. You will receive an email with recommendations.

The most common reason for a trigger to fire frequently is that it is not configured correctly. Before running a trigger, [check](/monitoring-services/alerting/triggers/triggers-add) that it is configured correctly.

To start a trigger:

1. [Go](https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/) to VK Cloud management console.
1. Go to the **Monitoring â†’ Alerts** section.
1. Click ![more-icon](/en/assets/more-icon.svg "inline") for the required trigger and select **Enable**.
