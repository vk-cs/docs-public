The Cloud Audit service is designed to integrate your security information and event management system (SIEM) with the VK Cloud platform. The purpose of the integration is to organize centralized collection, storage, and transmission of messages about security events that come from cloud services and VK Cloud virtual machines.

The Cloud Audit service helps:

- Increase the transparency of using VK Cloud services.
- Reliably save the history of actions with confidential data in VK Cloud.
- Analyze user actions with data and, on this basis, improve the system of access control to sensitive information.
- Promptly investigate incidents.

The collected information about events is available in the VK Cloud personal account only for users with [roles](/en/tools-for-using-services/account/concepts/rolesandpermissions):

- project owner
- superadministrator
- project administrator
- observer

To work with the event log, Cloud Audit provides [tools](/en/monitoring-services/event-log/service-management/view-event-log) for searching, filtering, and exporting information about events.
