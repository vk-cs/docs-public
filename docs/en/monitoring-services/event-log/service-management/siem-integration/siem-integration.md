Connect your SIEM system to VK Cloud so that Cloud Audit can send it information about security events coming from your cloud services and virtual machines.

You can connect several SIEM systems to VK Cloud, and also set up several connections to the same SIEM system, for example, to receive data from VK Cloud in different formats. However, only one of these connections can be active at a time.

In your personal account, you can change [parameters](#edit_siem_connection) and [activity status](#activate_siem_connection) of connections, as well as [delete](#delete_siem_connection) unnecessary connections.
