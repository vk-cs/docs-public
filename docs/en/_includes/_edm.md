If your organization or sole proprietor works with another EDI operator from the [register of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation](https://www.nalog.gov.ru/rn77/oedo/search_edo/), set up roaming to exchange documents with VK LLC using its EDM participant ID â€” `2BM-7743001840-2012052807514600749280000000000`.
