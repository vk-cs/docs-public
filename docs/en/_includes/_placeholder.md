When the cluster runs out of resources, the autoscaler creates a new node and adds it to the cluster. This takes 4â€“7 minutes, during which time your application may be overloaded with traffic.

To reduce scaling time, set up overprovisioning. This will reserve resources on nodes to be available for high-priority tasks.

{cut(Overprovisioning mechanism)}

1. A [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) is created with a low priority.
1. Standby pods are automatically started, using the resources on the nodes.
1. When high-priority pods appear, they evict low-priority pods from the nodes.
1. The autoscaler requests additional nodes to handle the evicted low-priority pods.
