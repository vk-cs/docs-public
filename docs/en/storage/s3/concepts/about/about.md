## Description

Object Storage can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data anytime from anywhere on the Internet. These tasks can be accomplished using the VK Cloud Control Panel.

Cloud Storage stores data as objects in buckets. An object is a file and any additional metadata describing the file. To save a file to Cloud Storage, it must be loaded into a bucket. When the file is loaded as an object, you can set permissions on the object and any metadata.

Buckets are containers for objects. A project can have one or more buckets. Access to each bucket can be controlled by deciding who can create, delete, and enumerate objects in it. Additionally, you can view the access logs for the bucket and its objects.

The following tasks can be accomplished using the VK Cloud Control Panel:

- Bucket creation
- Loading an object into a bucket
- Object Access Control
- Object lifecycle management
- Copying an item to a directory
- Removing objects and buckets
