## About tariffication

The cost of Cloud storage service is given in [price list](https://cloud.vk.com/pricelist). You can use [calculator](https://cloud.vk.com/en/pricing) to calculate the total cost of the service usage.

Tariffication is based on the "pay as you go" principle: you pay only for the resources you have consumed up to second.

See [Billing](/en/intro/billing) for how the tools related to paying for platform services work.
