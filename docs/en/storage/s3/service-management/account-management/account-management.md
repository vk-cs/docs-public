Access to the resources of the "Object Storage" service when using the VK Cloud Panel is carried out without hindrance, if you have a registered and active account and VK Cloud project.

However, if you need to access resources through tools such as AWS CLI, S3 API, as well as any other software, you must create an additional account in the service and use the account key for access. This mechanism allows you to delimit access for the most comfortable and safe work with the service.
