Operations that can be performed with virtual desktops.


<info>

User guides for working in virtual desktops are available in PDF format. The choice of guide depends on the remote access subsystem specified in [service settings](/config/setup-ptrovider):

- [Termidesk](/ru/computing/cloud-desktops/service-management/assets/Termidesk_user_guide_v_1_0.pdf "download") — if the **Termidesk** subsystem is selected.
- [Cloud Desktop Client](/ru/computing/cloud-desktops/service-management/assets/Cloud_Desktop_user_guide_v_1_0.pdf "download") — if the **VK** subsystem is selected.
