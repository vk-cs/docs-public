The Cloud Desktop service allows you to use the following providers of remote access to desktops:

- [Termidesk](https://termidesk.ru/products/), developed by UVEON. Used by default.
- RemoteClick, VK's proprietary solution.

To select a provider of remote desktop access:

1. [Go to](https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/en) your VK Cloud management console.
1. Go to **Cloud Desktop** â†’ **Sevice settings**.
1. On the **Provider** tab, select `Termidesk` or `RemoteClick`.
1. Click **Save**.

<warn>

If you want to change the provider after creating a desktop pool, first delete all [desktop pools](../../desktops-pool/manage#deleting_a_desktop_pools) and the [service infrastructure](../../delete-vdi).
