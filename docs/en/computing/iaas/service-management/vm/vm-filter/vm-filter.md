Use filtering to quickly find the virtual machines you need:

1. [Go to](https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/en) your VK Cloud management console.

1. Go to **Cloud computing** → **Virtual machines**.

1. Click the **Search by instances** box. A list of available filters will open:

    - **Virtual machine types** — select the type: virtual machines, Kubernetes instances, or ML Platform.
    - **Statuses** — select the **Instance running** option to leave only active instances in the list.
    - **Backups** — use the option to check whether VMs are included in the automatic backup plan:

        - **Yes** — only VMs included in automatic backup plans will remain in the list.
        - **None** — only VMs that are not included in any automatic backup plan will remain in the list.

        <info>
        Manually creating VM backups does not affect filtering.
        </info>

    - **Tags** — select the required tags. Only VMs that have all the selected tags will remain in the list.
    - Filter by VM name — start filling in the search field. Only VMs which names begin with the entered characters will remain in the list.

Different filters can be combined for a more accurate VM search.
