    1. Specify basic settings:

       - **Tunnel name**.
       - **Public IPv4 address of the peer (Peer IP)**.
       - **Shared Key (PSK)**.

         If necessary, generate a key by clicking the corresponding button.

         <info>

         Valid characters:
         - uppercase and lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet;
         - numbers;
         - special characters `-`, `+`, `&`, `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `^`, `*`, `(`, `)`, `,`, `.`, `:`, `;`, `_`, `=`, `<`, `>`, `{`, `}`, `/`.

         The key must contain at least one letter or number.

         </info>

    1. (Optional) Specify advanced settings:

       - **Peer Router ID for Authentication (Peer ID)** — by default matches the peer address.
       - (For VPN in Sprut SDN only) **Селектор потоков траффика**:

         - **Объединить** — do not split traffic selectors, that is, wrap all address prefixes in one data transmission tunnel.
         - **Разделить** — split traffic selectors, that is, create a separate data transmission tunnel for each pair of address prefixes.

       - **Initiator State** — behavior when establishing an IPsec connection:

         - `bi-directional` (default) — the VK Cloud platform will attempt to establish a connection with a remote peer.
         - `response-only` — the platform expects a VPN connection to be initiated by a remote peer and does not attempt to establish one on its own.

       - Settings for detecting the unavailability of a remote peer (Dead Peer Detection, DPD):

         - **When a peer is unavailable** — determines the behavior of the VK Cloud platform if a remote peer is unavailable:

           - `hold` (default) — When an unreachable IPsec connection is detected, the connection is terminated. The connection can only be re-established by a remote peer.
           - `clear` — When an unreachable IPsec connection is detected, the connection is terminated. The connection will not be re-established even if the remote peer attempts to do so.
           - `restart` — When an unreachable IPsec connection is detected, the connection is terminated. The VK Cloud platform will try to re-establish a connection with the remote peer.

         - **Peer Downtime Detection Interval** — at what interval (in seconds) to send test DPD messages.

         - **Time to detect peer unavailable** — if after this time-out (in seconds) no DPD check messages were received from a remote peer, then it is considered unavailable (dead).

           The default value for this setting is four times the **Peer Downtime Detection Interval**.

1. Click the **Create VPN Tunnel** button.

         The key must contain at least one letter or number.

         </info>

   1. (Optional) Аdvanced settings:

      - **Peer Router ID for Authentication (Peer ID)** — by default matches the peer address.
      - (For VPN in Sprut SDN only) **Селектор потоков траффика**:

         - **Объединить** — do not split traffic selectors, that is, wrap all address prefixes in one data transmission tunnel.
         - **Разделить** — split traffic selectors, that is, create a separate data transmission tunnel for each pair of address prefixes.

         - `bi-directional` (default) — the VK Cloud platform will attempt to establish a connection with a remote peer.
         - `response-only` — the platform expects a VPN connection to be initiated by a remote peer and does not attempt to establish one on its own.

      - Settings for detecting the unavailability of a remote peer (Dead Peer Detection, DPD):

         - **When a peer is unavailable** — determines the behavior of the VK Cloud platform if a remote peer is unavailable:

           - `hold` (default) — when an unreachable IPsec connection is detected, the connection is terminated. The connection can only be re-established by a remote peer.
           - `clear` — when an unreachable IPsec connection is detected, the connection is terminated. The connection will not be re-established even if the remote peer attempts to do so.
           - `restart` — when an unreachable IPsec connection is detected, the connection is terminated. The VK Cloud platform will try to re-establish the connection with the remote peer.

         - **Peer Downtime Detection Interval** — the interval (in seconds) at which to send DPD test messages.

         - **Time to detect peer unavailable** — if during this interval (in seconds) no DPD test messages were received from a remote peer, then it is considered unavailable (dead).

           The default value for this setting is four times the **Peer Downtime Detection Interval**.

   1. Get a list of endpoint groups and view detailed information about them:

      ```bash
      openstack vpn endpoint group list
      ```

      ```bash
      openstack vpn endpoint group show <group id>
      ```

      Write down:

      - ID of the group that will be used by the VPN tunnel as the local endpoint group. Such a group must be of type `subnet`.

         The subnets belonging to the group must be connected to the router that was specified in the previous step in the VPN service settings.

      - ID of the group that will be used by the VPN tunnel as the remote endpoint group. Such a group must be of type `cidr`.

   1. If there is no suitable local endpoint group, create it:

      <tabs>
      <tablist>
      <tab>Linux/macOS (bash, zsh)</tab>
      <tab>Windows (PowerShell)</tab>
      </tablist>
      <tabpanel>

      ```bash
      openstack vpn endpoint group create <local endpoint group name> \
      --type subnet \
      --value <subnet ID of the VK Cloud platform connected to the router, which should be accessible through the VPN tunnel> \
      ...
      --value <additional subnet ID>
      ```

      </tabpanel>
      <tabpanel>

      ```powershell
       openstack vpn endpoint group create <local endpoint group name> `
         --type subnet `
         --value <subnet ID of the VK Cloud platform connected to the router, which should be accessible through the VPN tunnel> `
         ...
         --value <additional subnet ID>
      ```

      </tabpanel>
      </tabs>

      After creation, information about the created object will be displayed, including its identifier. Write down the ID of the local endpoint group that will be used by the VPN tunnel.

   1. If there is no suitable remote endpoint group, create it:

      <tabs>
      <tablist>
      <tab>Linux/macOS (bash, zsh)</tab>
      <tab>Windows (PowerShell)</tab>
      </tablist>
      <tabpanel>

      ```bash
       openstack vpn endpoint group create <remote endpoint group name> \
         --type cidr \
         --value "<remote subnet in the format 10.0.0.0/24 that should be accessible through the VPN tunnel>" \
         ...
         --value "<optional remote subnet>"
      ```

      </tabpanel>
      <tabpanel>

      ```powershell
       openstack vpn endpoint group create <remote endpoint group name> `
         --type cidr `
         --value "<remote subnet in the format 10.0.0.0/24 that should be accessible through the VPN tunnel>" `
         ...
         --value "<optional remote subnet>"
      ```

      </tabpanel>
      </tabs>

      After creation, information about the created object will be displayed, including its identifier. Write down the ID of the remote endpoint group that will be used by the VPN tunnel.

1. Edit the VPN tunnel settings:

   <tabs>
   <tablist>
   <tab>Linux/macOS (bash, zsh)</tab>
   <tab>Windows (PowerShell)</tab>
   </tablist>
   <tabpanel>

   ```bash

      --name <new VPN tunnel name> \
      --dpd action=<action when peer is unavailable>,interval=<check interval>,timeout <check time-out> \
      --initiator <behavior when establishing an IPsec connection: bi-directional, response-only> \
      --peer-address "<VPN peer address>" \
      --peer-id "<VPN peer ID>" \
      --local-endpoint-group <local endpoint-group id> \
      --peer-endpoint-group <remote endpoint-group ID> \
      --enable
   ```
  
   </tabpanel>
   <tabpanel>

   ```powershell
    openstack vpn ipsec site connection set <VPN tunnel ID> `
      --name <new VPN tunnel name> `
      --dpd action=<action when peer is unavailable>,interval=<check interval>,timeout <check time-out> `
      --initiator <behavior when establishing an IPsec connection> `
      --peer-address "<VPN peer address>" `
      --peer-id "<VPN peer ID>" `
      --local-endpoint-group <local endpoint-group id> `
      --peer-endpoint-group <remote endpoint-group id> `
      --enable
   ```
