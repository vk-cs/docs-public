You can delete a CDN resource in two ways:

- [Through the CDN service interface](#deleting_resource_via_cdn_service_interface).

- [Through the bucket interface](#deleting_resource_via_bucket_interface) in the [Cloud Storage](/en/base/s3) service. Use this if the CDN resource [was created trough the bucket interface](../create-resource#creating_resource_via_bucket_interface).

## Deleting resource via CDN service interface

This is a group operation: you can delete several CDN resources at once by setting the checkboxes.

To delete a CDN resource:

   - Set the checkbox for the required resource, then click **Delete** above the table.
