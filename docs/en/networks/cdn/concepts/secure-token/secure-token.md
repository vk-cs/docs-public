*Secure token* is an option that allows you to protect your CDN resource files from unwanted downloads.

With Secure token, you can set up temporary access to content and ensure the security of your data.

When the option is enabled, access to files is granted through pre-signed URLs that contain a special code (secure token). When a user clicks the link, the CDN compares the received token with a hash calculated from the resource secret key and request parameters, and based on the result, it either allows or denies access to the content.

A pre-signed URL looks like this:

```plaintext
http://cdn.example.com/files/image.jpg?md5=CUQ1rzAvtQCxwLS&expires=1301605293
```

Here:

- `md5=CUQ1rzAvtQCxwLS` — secure token in the form of an md5 hash of a string that contains:

  - secret key
  - link expiration time
  - file path in the origin
  - (optionally) allowed IP address

- `expires=1301605293` — link expiration time in Unix timestamp format.

The signed URL is generated by your website, which must have a special script added for this purpose.

If Secure token is enabled for a CDN resource, the content will only be accessible via pre-signed URLs. To allow access to part of the content via regular URLs, [create](/en/networks/cdn/service-management/create-resource) another resource with a separate [origin](/en/networks/cdn/concepts/origin-groups).
