<summary>Can I use HTTP/2 protocol?</summary>

CDN servers have HTTP/2 enabled by default. If the origin servers do not support HTTP/2, they will deliver the content using a supported protocol (for example, HTTP/1.1). In this case, the browser combines all received content into a single page, even if it is received via different protocols. Read more about [HTTP/2 support](../concepts/http2-support).
