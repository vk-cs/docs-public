Private DNS in VK Cloud is the functionality of a DNS server running in the project networks of the platform. Allows you to access instances by DNS names.

The service supports configuring the private zone and port names of virtual machines. The DNS server responds to the same addresses as the DHCP ports on the network. For private DNS to work on the network, a DHCP server must be enabled.

<warn>

At the moment, the private DNS request forwarding servers are `8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`. Changing these addresses is not supported.
