<tabpanel>

1. Make sure that:

   1. Make sure that OpenStack client [is installed](/en/tools-for-using-services/cli/openstack-cli#1_install_the_openstack_client) and [authenticate](/en/tools-for-using-services/cli/openstack-cli#3_complete_authentication) to the project.
   1. Install `python-octaviaclient` package in the OpenStack CLI client.

1. To see a list of load balancers and their identifiers, run the command:

   ```bash
   openstack loadbalancer list
   ```

1. To see detailed information about a load balancer, run the command:

   ```bash
   openstack loadbalancer show <load balancer ID>
   ```

   General information about the load balancer and identifiers will be displayed:

   - `vip_port_id` is the identifier of the port that is used as the Virtual IP on the load balancer. You can assign a floating IP address to this port.

   - `listeners` is a list of listener object IDs. These objects listen for incoming connections to the load balancer and serve as an entry point for traffic.

   - `pools` is a list of pools identifiers. These objects serve to group the end users of traffic. Consumers act as members of the pool. Traffic from the listener object is balanced between several members of the pool configured for the listener object.

1. To see the listener object settings and their relations to pools, run the command:

   ```bash
   openstack loadbalancer listener show <listener object ID>
   ```

1. To see the pool settings and the list of members of that pool, run the command:

   ```bash
   openstack loadbalancer pool show <pool ID>
   ```

1. To see the settings of an individual participant from the pool, run the command:

   ```bash
   openstack loadbalancer member show <pool ID <member ID>
   ```

   Information will be displayed for the member, including the traffic destination port.

## Managing balancing rules

<tabs>
<tablist>
<tab>Management console</tab>
<tab>OpenStack CLI</tab>
</tablist>
<tabpanel>

1. [Go](#viewing_a_list_of_load_balancers_and_information_about_them) to the balancer page to edit it.
1. In the **Balancer rules** section perform one of the available actions:

   1. Add a balancing rule.
   Edit an existing balancing rule by clicking the pencil icon next to the rule.
   1. Remove an existing balancing rule by clicking on the trashcan icon next to the rule.

The following options are available when adding or editing a rule:

1. Rule options:

   - **Protocols and Ports** (only when creating a rule):

     - The balancing protocol and port to be used by the balancer.
     - Destination protocol and port.

     If you select `TCP` balancing protocol, two destination protocols are available: `TCP` or `PROXY`. The Proxy protocol can be used if it is supported by the servers behind the balancer.

   - **Balancing method**:

     - `LEAST_CONNECTIONS`: use the backend to which the least number of connections are established.
     - `ROUND_ROBIN`: go through all backends one by one.
     - `SOURCE_IP`: assign a backend for handling traffic to a specific client IP address.

   - **Allowed cidrs**: IP addresses or subnet addresses from which connections to the balancer are allowed. This parameter can be used to restrict access to the balancer from trusted addresses only.

     If the parameter is not set, connections are allowed from any IP addresses (which is equivalent to CIDR `0.0.0.0/0`).

   - **Timeout parameters**:

     - `Client data`: client inactivity time-out.
     - `Member connect`: backend connection time-out.
     - `Member data`: backend inactive time-out.
     - `TCP inspect`: time-out for additional TCP segments during content inspection.

     The time-out values are set in milliseconds. The minimum value is `0`, the maximum value is `2073600000` (576 hours).

   - **Send X-Forwarded-For header** (for HTTP and HTTPS balancing protocols only): an option that allows you to enable the corresponding HTTP header to be sent to the backend. By default the option is disabled.

   - **Sticky sessions**: the option provides long-term connection with the server with data saved throughout the entire session.

      If the option is enabled, requests are executed between servers using the selected balancing method, but after connecting, the session is assigned to the selected server. All requests for this session will be sent to the same server, regardless of the balancing method. The session will not end until the user ends it or until the server becomes unavailable. In this case, requests will be transferred to the second server according to the balancing rules.

      Field **Type** allows you to configure the session settings:

      - **APP-cookie**: the session is determined by the cookie specified in the application code. If this option is selected, in the **Cookie name** field, enter the cookie that identifies the session.
      - **HTTP-cookie**: the session is determined by the cookie that the load balancer creates during connections to the server and attaches to the session.
      - **Source IP**: the client’s IP address is used to bind the session to the server. Use this type only if the client's IP address does not change during the session.

   - **Apply to the following instances**: tools to select virtual machine instances that will act as backends for the balancer. You can add an instance either by selecting it from the list or by selecting the tag assigned to the instance.

     <info>

     The security groups for the selected virtual machines must be configured to allow traffic to the destination port and protocol.

     </info>

   - **Certificate** (HTTPS balancing protocol only): the certificate to be used by the balancer to terminate the SSL connection.

     You can select an existing certificate or load a new one.

     When you load a new certificate, specify:

     - **Certificate Name**.
     - **Certificate and chain of certificates**: a public certificate or certificate chain. You can either paste it into the field in text form or load it from a file.
     - **Private key**: A private certificate. Can be inserted into the field in text form or loaded from a file.
     - **Password**: password of the private certificate (if used). You can insert it into the field in text form or load it from a file.

1. Backend availability check options (healthcheck):

   - **Method of checking**: TCP or HTTP.
   - **Interval**: check interval in seconds.
   - **Number of attempts**: the number of times to try before the backend is deemed inaccessible.
   - **Timeout**: time-out in seconds, after which it is considered that the backend does not respond to the check.

   The following parameters are only available for the `HTTP` validation type:

   - **HTTP method**: the method to use to check availability.
   - **Response status**: [HTTP status](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) which will make the accessibility check a success.
   - **Query path**: the path to use to test accessibility.

1. Make sure that:

   1. Make sure that OpenStack client [is installed](/en/tools-for-using-services/cli/openstack-cli#1_install_the_openstack_client) and [authenticate](/en/tools-for-using-services/cli/openstack-cli#3_complete_authentication) to the project.
   1. Install `python-octaviaclient` package in the OpenStack CLI client.

1. To create a balancing rule:

   1. [Get the load balancer ID](#viewing_a_list_of_load_balancers_and_information_about_them) for which to create a rule.

   1. Create a pool in which the traffic consumers will be placed:

      <tabs>
      <tablist>
      <tab>Linux/macOS (bash, zsh)</tab>
      <tab>Windows (PowerShell)</tab>
      </tablist>
      <tabpanel>

      ```bash
      openstack loadbalancer pool create \
        --loadbalancer <loadbalancer ID> \
        --name <pool name> \
        --protocol <destination protocol> \
        --lb-algorithm <balancing algorithm>
      ```

      </tabpanel>
      <tabpanel>

      ```powershell
      openstack loadbalancer pool create `
        --loadbalancer <loadbalancer ID> `
        --name <pool name> `
        --protocol <destination protocol> `
        --lb-algorithm <balancing algorithm>
      ```

      </tabpanel>
      </tabs>

      Write down the identifier of the created pool (`id`).

   1. Find the IP addresses of the virtual machines that will be members of the pool. Also [find the ID](/en/networks/vnet/service-management/net#viewing_the_list_of_networks_and_subnets_and_information_about_them) subnet where the virtual machines are located.

      These virtual machines must either be located on the subnet where the balancer for which the balancing rule is being created is located, or be accessible from that subnet.

   1. For each such virtual machine, create a member object that will be a member of the created pool:

      <tabs>
      <tablist>
      <tab>Linux/macOS (bash, zsh)</tab>
      <tab>Windows (PowerShell)</tab>
      </tablist>
      <tabpanel>

      ```bash
      openstack loadbalancer member create <pool ID> \
        --name <member name> \
        --address <IP address of the virtual machine> \
        --subnet-id <subnet ID> \
        --protocol-port <destination port number>
      ```

      </tabpanel>
      <tabpanel>

      ```powershell
      openstack loadbalancer member create <pool ID> `
        --name <member name> `
        --address <IP address of the virtual machine> `
        --subnet-id <subnet ID> `
        --protocol-port <destination port number>
      ```

      </tabpanel>
      </tabs>

      <warn>

      All member objects within the same pool must use the same port.

      </warn>

   1. Create a healthcheck object for the pool. It will check the status and availability of members in the pool.

      <tabs>
      <tablist>
      <tab>Linux/macOS (bash, zsh)</tab>
      <tab>Windows (PowerShell)</tab>.
      </tablist>
      <tabpanel>

      ```bash
      openstack loadbalancer healthmonitor create <pool id> \
        --name <healthcheck object name> \
        --delay <delay, sec> \
        --timeout <timeout, sec> \
        --max-retries <number of successful retries> \
        --max-retries-down <number of unsuccessful retries> \
        --type <type of healthcheck>
      ```

      </tabpanel>
      <tabpanel>

      ```powershell
      openstack loadbalancer healthmonitor create <pool id> `
        --name <healthcheck object name> `
        --delay <delay, sec> `
        --timeout <timeout, sec> `
        --max-retries <number of successful retries> `

        --type <type of healthcheck>
      ```

      </tabpanel>
      </tabs>

   1. Create a listener object to handle incoming connections:

      <tabs>
      <tablist>
      <tab>Linux/macOS (bash, zsh)</tab>
      <tab>Windows (PowerShell)</tab>
      </tablist>
      <tabpanel>

      ```bash
      openstack loadbalancer listener create <load balancer ID> \
        --name <listener object name> \
        --protocol <balancing protocol> \
        --default-pool <pool ID> \
        --protocol-port <port number>
      ```

      </tabpanel>
      <tabpanel>

      ```powershell
      openstack loadbalancer listener create <load balancer ID> `
        --name <listener object name> `
        --protocol <balancing protocol> `
        --default-pool <pool ID> `
        --protocol-port <port number>
      ```

      </tabpanel>
      </tabs>

1. To apply (`set`) the necessary settings to objects that are part of a balancing rule, or to override the settings (`unset`), use the appropriate commands (for example, `openstack loadbalancer pool set`).

1. To remove a balancing rule:

   1. Find the ID of the necessary listener object.

   1. Determine the ID of the pool used by that listener-object:

      1. Execute the command:

         ```bash
         openstack loadbalancer listener show <listener object ID>
         ```

      1. The pool ID will be contained in the `default_pool_id` field.

   1. Remove the listener object:

      ```bash
      openstack loadbalancer listener delete <listener object ID>
      ```

   1. Delete the pool:

      ```bash
      openstack loadbalancer pool delete <pool ID>
      ```
