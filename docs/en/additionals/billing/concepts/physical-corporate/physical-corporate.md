This article describes the work schemes and opportunities that are available in VK Cloud to individuals and legal entities.

By default, the scheme of work for individuals is used in new projects. This scheme does not imply receiving accounting [accounting documents](../../concepts/report) from VK Cloud.

For the convenience of legal entities, opportunities have been implemented that allow you to receive accounting documents, optimize document management and help pay for services more conveniently. These options need to be additionally connected and configured in the project.

Organizations and individual entrepreneur can work with VK Cloud as individuals or legal entities of their choice.

<info>

If you plan to work with VK Cloud as a legal entity, go through [pre-registration](#additional_registration_of_legal_entities) in your personal account.

## Payment scheme

### Prepayment

The user [deposits](../../instructions/payment#making_a_payment) the project balance in advance for a certain amount. The deposited funds are transferred to the main account of the project, from where they are then spent on paying for services. If a project goes into negative territory, it is automatically [frozen](/en/base/account/concepts/projects#automatic_freezing_of_the_project) until the balance becomes positive.

<tablist>
<tab>Individuals</tab>
<tab>Legal entities</tab>
</tablist>
<tabpanel>

Individuals work with VK Cloud only on prepayment.

</tabpanel>
<tabpanel>

By default, legal entities work on prepayment, but they can also work on post-payment.

When working on prepayment, only a universal transfer document is provided to a legal entity from [accounting documents](../../concepts/report#individuals). Other documents are optional.

</tabpanel>
</tabs>

### Post-payment

The user is billed once a month for using the services, which he pays for. The project balance under this scheme is always negative, but the project is not [frozen](/en/base/account/concepts/projects#automatic_freezing_of_the_project).

<tabs>
<tablist>
<tab>Individuals</tab>
<tab>Legal entities</tab>
</tablist>
<tabpanel>

Individuals cannot work on a post-payment.

</tabpanel>
<tabpanel>

Post-payment work is available if you conclude an [individual contract](#type_of_contract) with VK Cloud, in which this scheme is fixed. By default, legal entities work on prepayment.

When working on post-payment, only a universal transfer document is provided to a legal entity from [accounting documents](../../concepts/report#individuals). Other documents are optional.

</tabpanel>
</tabs>

## Type of contract

<tabs>
<tablist>
<tab>Individuals</tab>
<tab>Legal entities</tab>
</tablist>
<tabpanel>

Individuals work with the platform under [public offer agreements](/en/additionals/start/legal) relevant services. On the part of VK Cloud, public offer agreements are concluded:

- for projects in [region](/en/base/account/concepts/regions) Moscow — on behalf of “VK” LLC, registered in the Russian Federation;
- for projects in the region of Kazakhstan — on behalf of “QazCloud” LLP, registered in Kazakhstan.

</tabpanel>
<tabpanel>

Legal entities work with VK Cloud either on the basis of contracts [public offer](/en/additionals/start/legal/) of the relevant services, or under an individual contract.

For all questions related to contracts, please contact the VK Cloud Document management department:

- in [region](/en/base/account/concepts/regions) Moscow — at the address docs_vktech@vk.company;
- in the region of Kazakhstan — at the address accountvk@qazcloud.kz.

### Public offer agreements

By default, all users work under public offer contracts. On the part of VK Cloud, public offer agreements are concluded:

- for projects in region Moscow — on behalf of “VK” LLC, registered in the Russian Federation;
- for projects in the region of Kazakhstan — on behalf of “QazCloud” LLP, registered in Kazakhstan.

### Individual agreement

if your legal entity is not a resident of the country corresponding to the project region, or you need more flexible terms of the contract — for example, a [postpaid](#post_payment) settlement scheme — [enter into an individual agreement](../../instructions/corporate#conclusion_of_an_individual_contract) with VK Cloud.

## Recommended payment methods

Both individuals and legal entities have access to all [payment methods](../../concepts/payment-methods) in the relevant region, but some of them are more convenient for individuals, others for legal entities.

<tabs>

<tab>Individuals</tab>
<tab>Legal entities</tab>
</tablist>
<tabpanel>

A bank card linked to the project is the most convenient payment method. Advantages of this method:

- you can set up [auto-top-up](../../instructions/add-card#configure_auto_completion) balance;
- when depositing manually, you do not need to enter the card details every time.

</tabpanel>
<tabpanel>

It is recommended to pay for services by bank transfer, since only such payments can be reflected in [accounting documents](../../concepts/report#electronic_document_management_system_edm_aece81aa).

<info>

Legal entities can also top up the project balance with a bank card — for example, if you need to urgently transfer funds to avoid freezing the project. Subsequently, you can [re-credit](../../faq/qa-corporate#how_to_make_a_payment_from_a_card_in_accounting_documents_for_a_legal_entity) a one-time payment from the card for its correct reflection in the accounting documents.

</info>

</tabpanel>
</tabs>

## Additional registration of legal entities

[Additional registration](../../instructions/corporate) means saving the details of a legal entity in the project settings in the personal account. You do not need to specify banking details manually, they are filled in automatically after entering the individual taxpayer number.

After additional registration, those organizations that work on [prepayment](#payment_scheme) can upload [invoices for payment](../../instructions/bill-generation) with full details from the personal cabinet.
