## Payment, refund, bonuses

<details>

<summary>How do I get bonuses for registering in my personal account?</summary>

[Bonuses](../concepts/balance#bonuses) are credited when registering a new account. Bonuses are credited after the activation of services in the project, when all the stages of [account confirmation](/en/additionals/start/account-registration#2_confirm_your_account) have been completed.

<info>

When creating new projects by existing users and when a new user enters the project by invitation, bonuses are not awarded.

</info>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why did the bonuses run out?</summary>

[Bonuses](../concepts/balance#bonuses) in VK Cloud are spent on using cloud services and resources. One bonus is equal to one ruble.
Bonuses are given for 60 days, after that they burn off.

<warn>

You cannot withdraw bonuses from the project.

</warn>

You can see the details of your expenses on the **Balance** page in your personal account.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Are funds being charged after the end of the test period?</summary>

After the test period has expired or bonuses have been burned off, the main balance is used to pay for resources. If the balance is zero, the project is [frozen](/en/base/account/concepts/projects#automatic_freezing_of_the_project). If the balance is positive, funds will be charged for resource usage.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How are funds charged (daily or monthly)?</summary>

Resource consumption in the cloud is registered every minute.
Charges from the project balance for recorded resource consumption occur every minute as well. For some resources (licenses) charging occurs once a day.

VK Cloud registers the consumption of resources in the cloud on a minute-by-minute basis. Funds for resource usage are also charged from the balance minutely. Licenses are charged once a day.

</details>

<details>

<summary>The project does not display the balance at all. How do I turn it on?</summary>

[Balance](../concepts/balance) is displayed:

- If your [role](/en/base/account/concepts/rolesandpermissions) in the project is the owner, superadministrator or billing administrator.
- After the services are activated in the project. To understand if the services are activated:

  1. Go to VK Cloud [personal account](https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/en/).
  1. Go to the section of any service. If the **Enable services** button is displayed, [activate](/en/base/account/instructions/activation) them by pressing this button.

    During activation, you may need to confirm the phone number and link the payment card.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the risk of a negative balance?</summary>

Negative balance is a negative value of personal account balance for clients on prepaid payment system.
No penalties are charged on negative balance. To use the services and resources of the project it is necessary to have a positive balance.

<warn>

Unlocking of services takes up to 4 hours from the moment of crediting.

</warn>

</details>

<details>

<summary>How much do I need to replenish my account to resume work?</summary>

Project is automatically resumed when the balance is positive.
It is recommended to deposit an amount equal to the daily charge, or enable [auto-top-up](../instructions/add-card#configure_auto_completion).

</details>

<details>

<summary>I have paid the bill, the services in the project are active. Why is the balance negative?</summary>

You are probably a legal entity and work with VK Cloud for a post-payment. In this case, the balance of your project will always be negative.

If you do not know your payment scheme, contact the VK Cloud document management Department for clarification at the address [docs_vktech@vk.company](mailto:docs_vktech@vk.company).

Specify the full name and details of the organization.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How to pay for the work of a service from a legal entity?</summary>

If you work with VK Cloud on prepayment, [form an invoice](../instructions/bill-generation/) and pay it in your personal account.

When working on the post-payment scheme, the invoice and [accounting documents](../concepts/report#legal_entities) for the reporting period are sent via the electronic document management system (EDM) within five working days of the month following the reporting one.

If you have not received the accounting documents, contact VK Cloud document management department at [docs_vktech@vk.company](mailto:docs_vktech@vk.company). Specify the full name and details of the organization.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How to connect the post-payment scheme?</summary>

Post-payment is available:

- only for legal entities;
- only within the framework of an individual contract with VK Cloud.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How long does it take for funds to be credited when paying by bank transfer?</summary>

Up to 3 banking days.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why should I link a card if I am a legal entity and pay according to the details?</summary>

The card may be required if you work on prepayment, and you need to top up your balance urgently — for example, to avoid project [freezing](/en/base/account/concepts/projects#automatic_freezing_of_the_project).

Write-offs for payments from bank cards are not included in [accounting documents for legal entities](../concepts/report#composition_of_accounting_documents_55c18d7): billing report, reconciliation report.

</details>

<details>

<summary>When and how will I receive the accounting documents after payment?</summary>

<tabs>
<tablist>
<tab>Individuals</tab>
<tab>Legal entities</tab>
</tablist>

Immediately after the funds are credited, the receipt is sent to the email address of the project owner.

</details>

## Freezing the project

<details>

<summary>The balance has become negative, how can the services be restored?</summary>

When working on prepayment with a negative balance, the project is automatically [frozen](/en/base/account/concepts/projects#automatic_freezing_of_the_project). Its objects are placed in the queue for deletion for a period:

- 3 days if you have never replenished the project account.
- 30 days if you have topped up the project account at least once.

   <err>

   As soon as the storage period in the queue expires, all project resources will be permanently deleted!

   </err>

To restore the services:

1. Go to VK Cloud [personal account](https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/en/).
1. [Making a payment](../instructions/payment#making_a_payment) the balance of the main account of the project [in a convenient way](../concepts/payment-methods/).
1. Wait for the activation of services in the project. It can take up to 2 hours.
1. Manually activate project resources:

   - [virtual machines](/en/base/iaas/instructions/vm/vm-manage#starting_stopping_reboot_the_vm);
   - [Kubernetes containers](/en/base/k8s/operations/manage-cluster#start_cluster_ffb49399);
   - [vm backup](/en/manage/backups/vm-backup/vm-backup-manage#activating_stopping_and_deleting_a_backup_plan);
   - other resources.

<info>

To find out how long resources are in the queue for deletion, contact [technical support](/en/contacts), tell [project ID (PID)](/en/base/account/instructions/project-settings/manage#getting_the_project_id) and [region](/en/base/account/concepts/regions).

</info>

</details>

<details>

<summary>I have topped up my balance to unblock the services. How long to wait?</summary>

Unlocking can take up to 4 hours. If you need to restore the work of the project faster, contact [technical support](/en/contacts) and ask to unblock the services manually, specify [project ID (PID)](/en/base/account/instructions/project-settings/manage#getting_the_project_id) and [region](/en/base/account/concepts/regions).

After unlocking, manually start the objects that were stopped — for example, virtual machines.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I take the promised payment to avoid freezing?</summary>

The promised payment is not supported. You can avoid freezing the project if you have already made a payment, but it does not have time to arrive on the balance before the project goes into negative. Contact [technical support](/en/contacts) and ask them to disable the blocking of services for the duration of the payment. Provide information:

- [project ID (PID)](/en/base/account/instructions/project-settings/manage#getting_the_project_id);
- project [region](/en/base/account/concepts/regions);
- payment confirmation.

This situation is possible only when paying by bank transfer — when using other [payment methods](../concepts/payment-methods), the payment is credited almost instantly.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I don't have time to pay for services by transfer. How to avoid freezing?</summary>

There are two options for action:

- Pay for services with a bank card, payments from cards are faster.

  If you are a legal entity, you can subsequently transfer the payment from the card for correct reflection in the accounting documents.

- Pay for the services by bank transfer, contact [technical support](/en/contacts) and ask to disable the blocking of services for the duration of the payment. Provide information:

  - [project ID (PID)](/en/base/account/instructions/project-settings/manage#getting_the_project_id);
  - project [region](/en/base/account/concepts/regions);
  - payment confirmation.

</details>
