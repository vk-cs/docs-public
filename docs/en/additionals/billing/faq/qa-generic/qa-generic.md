## How do I get bonuses for registering in my personal account?

[Bonuses](../../concepts/balance) are credited when registering a new account. Bonuses are credited after the activation of services in the project, when all the stages of [account confirmation](/en/additionals/start/account-registration#2_confirm_your_account) have been completed.

If the bonuses have not appeared on the balance within three working days, contact [technical support](/ru/contacts), specify [project ID (PID)](/en/base/account/instructions/project-settings/manage#getting_the_project_id) and [region](/en/base/account/concepts/regions).

<info>

When creating new projects by existing users and when a new user enters the project by invitation, bonuses are not awarded.

## The project does not display the balance at all. How do I turn it on?

[Balance](../../concepts/balance) is displayed:

- If your [role](/en/base/account/concepts/rolesandpermissions) in the project is the owner, superadministrator or billing administrator.
- After the services are activated in the project. To understand if the services are activated:

  1. Go to VK Cloud [personal account](https://mcs.mail.ru/en/).
  1. Go to the section of any service. If the **Enable services** button is displayed, [activate](/en/base/account/instructions/activation) them by pressing this button.

    During activation, you may need to confirm the phone number and link the payment card.

## I have paid the bill, the services in the project are active. Why is the balance negative?

You are probably a legal entity and work with VK Cloud for a post-payment. In this case, the balance of your project will always be negative.

If you do not know your payment scheme, contact the VK Cloud document management Department for clarification:

- in [region](/en/base/account/concepts/regions) Moscow — at the address docs_vktech@vk.company;
- in the region of Kazakhstan — at the address accountvk@qazcloud.kz.

Specify the full name and details of the organization.

## How to connect the post-payment scheme?

Post-payment is available:

- only for legal entities;
- only within the framework of an individual contract with VK Cloud.

## How long does it take for funds to be credited when paying by bank transfer?

Up to 3 banking days.

## Why should I link a card if I am a legal entity and pay according to the details?

The card may be required if you work on prepayment, and you need to top up your balance urgently — for example, to avoid project [freezing](/en/base/account/concepts/projects#automatic_freezing_of_the_project).

Subsequently, a one-time payment from the card can be re-credited for correct reflection in [accounting documents](../../concepts/report).

## When and how will I receive the accounting documents after payment?

As part of the package of [accounting documents](../../concepts/report) for the corresponding reporting period (month).

When working through the electronic document management system (EDM), documents are available immediately. If the organization maintains a paper document flow with VK Cloud, the delivery time of the original documents is added.

Scanned copies of documents can be provided by e-mail by agreement.

## How do I get a payment receipt from a specific date?

Contact [technical support](/en/contacts), provide information:

- [project ID (PID)](/en/base/account/instructions/project-settings/manage#getting_the_project_id);
- project [region](/en/base/account/concepts/regions);
- amount and date of payment;
- payment confirmation.

## I have topped up the balance, but the payment is not credited. What to do?

The terms of crediting funds depend on [the payment method](../../concepts/payment-methods):

- Payment by bank transfer — payment can take up to three banking days from the date of transfer of funds by the bank.
- Payment by other methods — the payment is credited within 5-10 minutes after payment confirmation.

If the payment is not received within the specified time, contact [technical support](/en/contacts) to search for it, provide information:

- [project ID (PID)](/en/base/account/instructions/project-settings/manage#getting_the_project_id);
