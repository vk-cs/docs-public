It is necessary to form invoices:

- To pay for services by bank transfer. When paying by other [methods] (../../concepts/payment-methods), the account is not needed.
- If the user works with VK Cloud on prepayment. When working on a post-payment, the user receives invoices for payment from VK Cloud.

To create an invoice:

1. Go to [personal account](https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/en/) VK Cloud.
1. Open the balance page using one of these options:

   - Click on your user name in the top part of the personal account page and select **Balance and payments** from the drop-down list.
   - Select the **Balance** section in the side menu.

1. Click the **Make a payment** button.
1. In the window that opens, specify the amount of the deposit.
1. Select the option **Bank transfer** and click **Continue**.

An invoice for the specified amount will be automatically generated and uploaded to your computer.

For individuals and legal entities who have not passed [additional registration](../corporate#additional_registration_of_legal_entities) in the personal account, the account contains only the details of the service provider, the purpose of the payment and the amount to be paid.

If a legal entity has passed additional registration, the generated account contains the full details necessary for processing a bank payment order.

In the payment order, in the purpose of the payment, be sure to specify project [identifier (PID)](/en/base/account/instructions/project-settings/manage#getting_the_project_id).
