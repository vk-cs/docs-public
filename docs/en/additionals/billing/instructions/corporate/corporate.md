VK Cloud provides special features for [legal entities](../../concepts/physical-corporate/). Contractors-legal entities can receive accounting [accounting documents](../../concepts/report/) from the platform. They have the opportunity to conclude an individual contract with VK Cloud.

## Conclusion of an individual contract

Legal entities by default work with VK Cloud on the basis of contracts [public offer](/en/additionals/start/legal/legal-terms/). It is possible to conclude an individual contract with VK Cloud, for more information, see the article [Billing of individuals and legal entities](../../concepts/physical-corporate).

To conclude an individual contract:

1. Contact the VK Cloud document management Department:

   - in [region](/en/base/account/concepts/regions) Moscow — at the address docs_vktech@vk.company;
   - in the region of Kazakhstan — at the address accountvk@qazcloud.kz.

1. Let us know:

   - full name of the organization and its details;
   - full name and phone number of the contact person.

The manager will contact you to clarify the desired terms of the contract.

## Setting up the workflow

A contractor who works with VK Cloud as a legal entity receives a package of [accounting documents](../../concepts/report/) on their projects from the platform on a monthly basis. The document flow is carried out in electronic form (according to [EDM](../../concepts/report)) or, if work on EDM is impossible, in paper form.

## Additional registration of legal entities

After [registration](/en/additionals/start/account-registration) in VK Cloud, you can go to the project settings and complete the additional registration of the legal entity, specifying your details.

<info>

Filling in the details in the personal account is only available in [region](/en/base/account/concepts/regions) Moscow and only Russian legal entities.

</info>

If the organization works with VK Cloud on [prepayment](../../concepts/physical-corporate#predoplata), after additional registration, you will be able to [upload](../bill-generation/) from your personal account accounts that specify the details of both the supplier and the buyer of services. If the additional registration is not completed, only the details of the supplier are indicated in the invoice.

To complete additional registration:

1. In your VK Cloud personal account, go to [project settings](https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/en/project/legal/) to the **General information** tab.
1. Click the **Fill** button.
1. In the **Pre-registration** window, enter the TIN of the organization in the field of the same name.

   If the TIN is found in the contractor database, most of the organization's details will be filled in automatically.

1. Fill in the fields that were left empty and click **Next step**.
1. In the window that opens, specify the legal address of the organization.

   If the TIN is found in the contractor database, the address is filled in automatically. If necessary, the pre-filled field values can be edited.

   <info>

   If there is a [paper document flow](../../concepts/report) with the organization, VK Cloud always specifies which address to send them to before sending documents.
