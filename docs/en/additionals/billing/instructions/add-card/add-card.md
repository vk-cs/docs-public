## Bind the card

The card can be linked to the project:

- when [registering](/en/additionals/start/account-registration) account (if required);
- when [activating services](/en/base/account/instructions/activation) in the project (if required);
- independently at any time.

It is recommended to use physical bank cards to pay for services, since payments from virtual cards can be rejected by the security system.

<info>

Legal entities are recommended to pay for services using bank transfers. Card payments are not taken into account in [accounting documents](../../concepts/report#legal_entities).

</info>

To bind the card:

1. Go to [personal account](https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/en/) VK Cloud.

    - Click on the user name in the header of the page, select **Balance and payments** from the drop-down list.

    The amount at the top of the window will be debited from the card and credited to the [main account](../../concepts/balance) of the project.

1. Click the **Добавить карту** button.
1. In the payment confirmation window, enter the SMS code received from the bank.

    After successful debiting, the card will be linked.

## Configure auto-completion

Auto-top-up allows you to automatically top up the [main project account] (../../concepts/balance) from the linked card when the balance on the account reaches the specified value. You can set up auto-completion at any time.

The enabled auto-completion does not guarantee that there will always be funds on the project account. For example, if there are not enough funds on the card, the payment will not be made.

<warn>

In [region](/en/base/account/concepts/regions) Kazakhstan auto-completion is not available.

</warn>

To activate auto-completion:

1. Go to [personal account](https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/en/) VK Cloud.
1. Open the project balance page in one of the following ways:

    - Click on the user name in the header of the page, select **Balance and payments** from the drop-down list.
    - Go to **Balance**.

1. On the balance page, click on the link **Activate auto-top-up**.
1. Enable the option **Enable auto-top-up balance**.
1. Fill in the fields:

    - **Auto-top-up amount**: specify the amount in the range from `100` to `10000` rubles for which the balance will be automatically replenished.
    - **Replenishment with a balance**: specify the balance of funds at which auto-replenishment will occur — an amount in the range from `0` to `9999999` rubles.

1. Click the **Save** button.

## Unbind the card

To untie the card, contact [technical support](/en/contacts) and provide information:

- [project ID (PID)](/en/base/account/instructions/project-settings/manage#getting_the_project_id);
- the last 4 digits of the linked card number.

<info>

If you are a legal entity and work on prepayment, leave the card as an additional means of payment for urgent payments. In emergency cases, a one-time card payment can be re-credited for correct reflection in the accounting documents, for details, contact [technical support](/en/contacts).
