## About tariffication

<info>

The service is in BETA mode, so only infrastructure resources are charged.

</info>

The cost of individual components of the service is given in the [price list](https://cloud.vk.com/pricelist). To estimate the total cost of the service, use the [calculator](https://cloud.vk.com/pricing).

Charging is based on the ‘pay as you go’ principle: you are charged only for the resources you consume, accurate to the minute.

Read about how to pay for the service in the [Billing](/en/intro/billing) section.
