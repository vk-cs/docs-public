Quick start will help you to get started with the service and familiarize yourself with its features using the ADH Community cluster as an example.

After going through all the steps of the Quick start, you will:

1. Create a big data cluster in the ADH Community Test configuration.
1. Add a new component to the deployed cluster.

1. Select the project where you want to create a cluster.
1. Go to **Big Data** → **Clusters**.
1. Click the **Add Cluster** button.
2. In the "Configuration" step:

   1. Select the **ADH Community Test** cluster configuration.
   2. Specify the `2.1.8_b3` configuration version.

   </warn>

1. Click **Create cluster**.

   Wait for the cluster creation to complete, the process may take about 25–30 minutes.

   <info>

   In 5-8 minutes after startup, the ADCM interface will be available to monitor the progress of the installation process.

   </info>

## 2. Add Airflow component to cluster

1. [Go to](https://msk.cloud.vk.com/app/) to your VK Cloud Management Console.
1. Go to **Big Data** → **Clusters**.
1. Click the name of the created ADH cluster.
1. Navigate to the address specified in the **ADCM UI**. The ADCM console opens.
1. Enter the ADCM username and password that you set when creating the cluster.
1. Go to **CLUSTERS**.

## Remove unused resources

Cluster usage is [charged](../tariffication) and consumes computing resources. If you no longer need it:

1. [Delete](../service-management/delete/) the cluster.
1. If necessary, [remove the floating IP address](/en/networks/vnet/service-management/floating-ip#removing_floating_ip_address_from_the_project) assigned to the cluster nodes.
