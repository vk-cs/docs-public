Tariffication is based on the “pay as you go” principle: you are charged only for the resources you consume to the nearest minute, the fee for using paid OS is charged once a day.

The cost of network services is given in [price list](https://cloud.vk.com/pricelist). You can use [calculator](https://cloud.vk.com/pricing) to calculate the total cost of other platform services that use services. See [Billing](/en/intro/billing) for how the tools related to paying for platform services work.
